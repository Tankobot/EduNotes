"Charlotte takes no time in describing the living situation of Jane Eyre, which is to say the least, oppressive. "
"We experience a feeling that takes us away from the book by Jane reading a book herself. "
"Jane has now been characterized as a child who has a yearn for learning beyond the norm. "
"John is introduced and we know that he will become one of Jane's antagonist. "
"Charlotte is able to demonstrate how even the defenders of Jane are unable to help her from her antagonist, John. "
"Chapter 2"
"I find it very peculiar that the antagonist at this point in the book is named, ""John."""
"In the end stages of the book we learn of St. John, who eventually also becomes an antagonist, in a less direct manner. "
"At this point in time, Bessie is being disguised as an antagonist but later will become an important connection for Jane."
"Jane is adding up all of her problems in the world and it has me worrying what this will become as it progresses. "
"We see direct foreshadowing as Jane points out that she has plans to leave Gateshead. "
"We learn an important piece of information that provides setting for Jane's reason of residence. "
"In order to prevent us, the readers from thinking Jane as too apathetic, Jane demonstrates her fear of the unknown. "
"Chapter 3"
"The first helper of Jane Eyre is introduced although his presence is not long lived (Mr. Lloyd). "
"Jane characterizes herself by telling the reader that she does not feel a lingering presence. "
"Sadly, Jane is lying, or doesn't give herself enough credit, as later in the book she continues to be haunted by the incident. "
"Now we are given the information to lay the foundation of Bessie's good heart. "
"We hear that Mr. Reed had passed away in the room Jane Eyre was made to stay in. "
"Jane describes her want to leave, but we now understand the harder piece of the situation as Jane not having any family relations besides her aunt. "
"Jane expresses her desire to go to school and we now express somewhat the theme of women can proceed farther than common expectations. "
"Chapter 4"
"Jane Eyre has a tendency to test people by putting them on edge. "
"Here she puts aunt Reed on edge by blackmailing her with the wishes of her deceased husband. "
"The story progresses by leaving the setting the same, while changing the situation, "
"Jane now has a stronger to grow resentment, sine she is expected to act as a sort of servant towards her cousins who should be her equal. "
"Jane is given the prospect of school along with a few degrading comments. "
"Mr. Brocklehurst is introduced as our second antagonist, as he is the financial supporter of Lowood school, the school that Jane might be attending. "
"The comments that are said about Jane are mostly from Mrs. Reed, who describes her as sneaky and evil. "
"Jane Eyre is accepted into this school, leading forward to our next setting. "
"After the conversation, Jane asserts her own standing by explaining to Mrs. Reed, strongly, how she won't forget the way she was treated at Gateshead. "
"Bessie is characterized as a rational person in the eyes of Jane, as she hears what Jane has to say and considers it. "
"Chapter 5"
"Jane leaves Gateshead, transitioning our setting to the school of Lowood, a school for girls that follows christian faith. "
"We meet Miss Temple, although Charlotte decides that mystery is the best route to take, as it take half a day and a night in order for this snippet of information to be released. "
"Although it is not stated yet, Mr. Brocklehurst does not provide the school with very sufficient funds, and because of this their meals are less than adequate. "
"Miss Temple is described nearly instantly after her reveal that she actually is a kind person who understands some of the poor circumstances existing at the school. "
"Charlotte introduces a girl who will become Jane's friend quickly although we can see how foreshadowing is leading to a tragedy based on the description of “rancid” meat. "
"Chapter 6"
"We see a great comparison between Burns, Jane's friend, and Jane herself, as Burns is continually criticized by higher powers even when the only act she attempts to commit is good willed. "
"Burns is a devout Christian and I see this as a repeated motif in this story. "
"The Christianity motif might just be a coincidence of the time period of this book as Christianity was widely accepted as the norm. "
"Charlotte challenges the ideals of faith by describing that Jane is convinced that people should accept and respect those who punish unjustly, while Burns disagrees. "
"Chapter 7"
"The winter in this chapter is a metaphor for the hard times that Jane is experiencing at Lowood. "
"First order of business is Mr. Brocklehurst, who decides to arrive at the school. "
"He further convinces us of his antagonistic nature by complaining about the extra food eaten because of the inedible meals and the way that a girl's hair is being let to curl naturally. "
"He also antagonizes Jane by pointing her out in front of the school and describing her in the same way as Mrs. Reed had done. "
"We learn that the other girls of the school, including the staff, have a resentment towards Mr. Brocklehurst, thus allowing for them to not take his verbal attack on Jane seriously. "
"Chapter 8"
"I thought it was interesting that Bronte decided to compare silence to a person of the Indian ethnicity. "
"Although Jane assumes everyone will believe Brocklehurst, we know, as I discussed above, that they have resentment towards him. "
"The person talking in this section and comforting Jane is Burns foreshadowing their greater connection later. "
"Miss Temple quickly demonstrates a motherly attitude towards Jane and her friend Burns, as she does with all the children of the school. "
"We are once again hit with the motif that the school has less food because of the benefactor. "
"Jane quickly becomes sharper in mind as she stays at the school and is convinced  to excel in the kindness that Miss Temple provides. "
"Chapter 9"
"We see visual imagery being expressed throughout the entire introduction of this chapter as, Jane describes how beautiful Spring is. "
"This is used to subconsciously boost our mood. "
"Jane no longer communicates with burns as often, but instead a new friend, foreshadowing the disconnection of the old. "
"Disease is described as being a common problem at Lowood at this time, strengthening the idea that an ill fate will be brought upon someone. "
"Helen turns out to have an illness that at this point in time is not treatable. "
"Jane demonstrates her devotion to her friends, as she sneaks into the containment which Helen dwells and spends the last hours of Helen's life with her. "
"We are hit with an emotional impact which is cushioned by the time that Bronte makes pass. "
"Chapter 10"
"Jane summaries the next eight years of her life in one paragraph leaving much to be desired. "
"Good is able to win in this battle, since Brocklehurst is displaced by wealthy individuals who had children who attended the school. "
"The theme of coming of age is demonstrated here as Jane describes how she has less friends and how the superintendent Miss Temple, has left to live with a husband. "
"Jane has become a teacher at Lowood, although she is bored and uninterested with staying at the school any longer. "
"The theme of women accomplishing more than what is expected is demonstrated as Jane decides to advertise herself (something not allowed at the time) in the paper in order to find work. "

"We the reader get to feel how magnificent Thornfield is as Jane describes the place with grandness. "
"Jane is now the governess of the daughter of Mr. Rochester, who she has not met yet."
"I feel as if Adele, the pupil, is meant to be some sort of comedic relief for a book of this time. "
"Jane is shown around by Ms. Fairfax and the reader is familiarized with the surrounding of the setting. "
"Chapter 12"
"I find it interesting that Bronte spends very little time describing the tutoring done by Jane, instead remarking that it but happens. "
"We once again see the motif of women performing greater than expectation as Jane tells herself that she is accomplishing a life more vivid than most. "
"Bronte provides a leisurely set up to the introduction of Mr. Rochester, giving a relaxed tone. "
"Jane demonstrates her kindness and concern towards others by helping Mr. Rochester, unbeknownst to her. "
"She also expresses her stubbornness as she refuses to leave the man until he is able to continue on his way. "

"Chapter 13"
"Mr. Rochester demonstrates himself to be a man who does not care deeply for his daughter."

"Chapter 14"
"This chapter is once again a conversation between Jane and Rochester. "
"We get a direct piece of evidence of Jane's nature as when Mr. Rochester asks her if he was handsome, she responds with a no. "
"Rochester is so entertained by her response that he wishes to here her talk about herself, yet, Jane Eyre demonstrates herself as being someone of intellect who won't speak without reason. "
"When Mr. Rochester asks Jane for advice she tells him to do as he pleases, even though she knows that he wanted a specific response. "
"Jane speaks with Rochester almost playfully, this could be foreshadowing their relationship later. "
"Mr. Rochester amazingly describes to Jane his personal thoughts deeply, after only knowing her for a short time, showing his openness, at least towards Jane. "
"Jane expresses the theme in the paragraphs written to Rochester, you shouldn't settle for a lower self image, even if you have the wealth to support your faults. "
"Rochester and Jane use a metaphor to connect his personality to laws and motives. "
"Chapter 15"
"Rochester begins to describe the reason behind Adele, and the reason behind his distance from her."
"He uses various amounts of imagery throughout the story. "
"I noticed that the story continuously becomes side tracked on a tangent which could be purposeful. "
"Rochester could be using the story of himself as a way to extract emotions and answers from Jane. "
"The story that Rochester is describing is one of betrayal between himself and a French singer, perhaps attempting to give Jane information about his personality. "

"The setting established at this time is one of great commotion. Rochester and his guests arrive, and suddenly everyone in the Hall is on their best behavior. "
"Adele displays excitement at the prospect of seeing people of her class, which I think describes her as too prideful. "
"The women of the party are expressed as antagonists as they insult governesses, the position Jane holds. "
"Rochester demonstrates himself to be a complex man as he plays the piano and sings with Miss Ingram. "
"Chapter 19"
"The setting of this chapter remains nearly the same as before, with the hall being occupied by people of class. "
"The guests play a form of charades and Rochester and Ingram definitely demonstrate a connection between themselves. The problem with the connection is that it isn't real and doesn't benefit Rochester. "
"The next situation that presents itself, is the idea by Rochester to disguise himself as a gypsy in order to get information out of party members, specifically Jane. "
"It is assumed that he tells Ingram that Rochester's wealth is not what she thinks it is. "
"When he speaks to Jane, he questions her about feelings she has with any of the party members, but her stubbornness does not yield. "
"Chapter 20"

"Chapter 23"

"This is the part of the book that gets slightly more sappy as Jane confesses her love to Rochester and he back. "
"Jane makes a startling decision to marry Rochester and both her and Rochester seem to be joyous. "
"Chapter 24"
"Jane is losing a relationship with Fairfax as she does not agree with her decision. "
"Rochester is a person who is not easily swayed in opinion, and because of this he continues to give Jane information about gifts that she obviously does not wish for. "
"Jane's explanation to Ms. Fairfax is not adequate to calm her mind, and it makes the reader fear for the connection that Jane had with Fairfax. "
"Rochester continues to harass Jane with objects of wealth and he does not understand her character that prefers modesty. "
"Jane is not the type of person to be covered up by the image of wealth. "
"Jane Eyre also might be displaying the need to have strict structure in her life, since she decides that after the agreement to be married, she wants to maintain the distance between herself and Rochester. "
"Chapter 26"
"Jane prepares herself for the wedding yet it surprises me, that she doesn't seem to be at all concerned with her wedding or anxious. "
"Contrast is demonstrated here, as Rochester is anxious to bring the wedding together and into action, as if attempting to avoid a problem that might occur. "
"Mr. Mason and an accompanying individual show up at the wedding to prevent Rochester from marrying Jane, and then Bronte reveals the great secret. "
"To summarize the secret, Rochester is married to woman declared to be insane, yet he is still legally married to her. "
"Rochester proves great bravery, or insanity, as he willingly confirms everyone's suspicions by leading the mass into his home and into the area in which he kept his insane bride. "
"It's peculiar how even after this demonstration everyone is still convinced what he has done is morally wrong, an opinion that you as the reader should decide upon. "
"Chapter 27"
"Jane decides that she must leave Thornfield, testifying to her self opinion as being held stronger than her obligation to anyone else. "
"Rochester first attempts to explain himself concerning the events that occurred but we the reader can already tell by the length of the book, that this will not work. "
"Rochester's story almost feels as if it is the method by which Bronte expects to be able to make the anthologist feel pity for Rochester. (It worked on myself, to an extant) "
"Chapter 28"
"Jane indicates her dependence on wealth when she is dropped in the middle of England and has no money or food. "
"Luckily the setting changes and Jane arrives in a village where she learns to understand how the impoverish live their life. "
"Although most readers wouldn't realize it yet, Jane requests help from the church of the clergyman who will eventually bring Jane in to his home and provide hospitality with his sisters. "
"Chapter 30"
"Jane develops close relations with the members of the Moor household, and by doing this she situates a spot for herself in their family. "
"St. John is described as a person of few words and strong opinions, this will be important later. "
"St. John indicates that he has generosity as he offer Jane a job to teach children in the local area, to which Jane definitively answers with a positive. "
"Chapter 32"
"We gain a better understanding of Jane when she's teaching the children of the low class area. "
"She is unacquainted with people who have so little knowledge that it's a challenge for her to understand them. This could be a metaphor for the difficulty she has in connecting with common people from society. "
"Jane proves to the reader that she stall has strong feelings for Rochester as she describes that she continually dreams of him and their emotions. "
"St. John is indicated to have a love interest, Ms. Oliver, a love triangle could be foreshadowed but since I have completed this novel, I will assure that this series of events does not occur. "
"Chapter 34"
"It is revealed that Jane has inherited a large collection of money from her uncle, and instead of keeping it for herself, she uses it to bring back her friends and improve their living situation in the village. "
"It is also revealed that the Rivers, St. John, Hannah, etc. are actually the cousins of Jane Eyre so as to provide a plot twist no one saw coming. "
"Chapter 35"
"St. John exhibits a general emotion of vengeance that even Jane won't except or will make excuses in order to forgive. "
"As far as my own opinion is concerned, St. John is leaning the edge of insanity. "
"He continually convinced himself that Jane was agreeing to leaving with himself to India as his bride, even when she made her opinion crystal clear that she would not marry him. "
"Jane is validated as someone with a quick witted mindset as she provides a convincing (not enough for St. John) argument as to why she could not “throw away” her life while she could accomplish more and help a greater number of other by staying in England."
"Chapter 36"
"We learn that ill fate has been bestowed upon Mr. Rochester and Bronte cleverly uses the story she described earlier with Rochester's previous bride attempting to burn him in his bed, as a way of hinting to the reader now what had happened to the Hall. "
"Rochester, while being described by another person, testifies himself to his mode of putting others before himself when he stayed in his hall while it burned as he evacuated everyone outside. "
"While he was evacuating his previous bride, she decided to jump off of the roof, and while Rochester was trying to leave the building he lost an arm, an eye, and his vision. Once again Bronte is pulling out the pity recipe. "
"Chapter 37"
"Jane is finally reacquainted with Rochester who is now blind and is very paranoid about the existence of whether Jane is really with him or not, which he has the right to, after what he's gone through. "
"This is the section of the novel that made me want to throw it across the room. "
"Apparently during a night previous, Rochester had heard Jane call him in the night (before Jane had left the village. Jane also did yell out to him at the village the same night after speaking with St. John) and he responded by calling her name, which Jane thought she had heard while at the village. "
"This ruined a large draw of the ending for me. "
"Bronte does amazing job at making the reader feel relieved that Jane and Rochester are once again together. "
"I won't forget the age difference between the couple but as long as they both know that it exists I can feel accepting of the idea. "
"The couple marries since his previous bride has died coincidentally, and they live happily ever after, the end, almost, the conclusion. "
"Chapter 38"
"Bronte takes this chapter to wrap up and compile any information that she feels is necessary for the reader to know. "
"Adele is sent to a school that she enjoys greatly and she slowly becomes a kind woman. "
"We are described to how Jane helps Rochester to see the world around him and we can infer that this closely connects them together, as he is dependent upon her. Although, I like to believe that her strong willed mind is what keeps them so attached. "
"We learn that Jane and Rochester maintain contact with Diana and Mary and continue to connect as family. But, "
"I am disappointed slightly that the last line of the story is given to St. John (the character I deemed the least stable). "
