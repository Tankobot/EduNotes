# The New Imperialism, 1869 - 1914

## The New Imperialism: Motives and Methods

As imperialism was expanding and becoming more popular, it's important to note the motives that drove states to expand, the most common reason being an attempt to regain lost land of the past and to establish new economic opportunities in remote regions. In addition to the political motivations of the states, they also had cultural motives such as the want to convert people to their own religion in an attempt to correct and civilize people. And, states tended to request that their commercial and industrial businesses be able to secure monopolistic rights over raw materials within their own state. All of this was made possible by the industrial revolution which was able to lower the cost of expansion to the point where imperialist empires could effectively build themselves outward. Finally the issue of colonial governments was a common one and it usually depended on the population, with highly European populations using their own self-rule and colonies with indigenous people using autocratic European leaders.

## The Scramble for Africa

Countries such as France saw the benefits of having regions of Africa under their control, and through the efforts of a few important people such as Henry Stanley and Savorgnan de Brazza, Africa was slowly put under Europe's control. One of the early reasons that the Europeans found themselves in Africa was do to a conflict with in which Britain and France decided that they needed to intervene between the Egyptians and the Ottomans if they wanted to make sure that their investments would survive. Africa slowly became more and more popular among Europeans due to its fair lands for farming and its abundance of valuable raw resources such as diamonds, gold, and copper, and these Europeans began to threaten the local populations such as the Zulu. But it wasn't all successful, as many consequences also came as a result such as communities who were used to their ways, fought back against the European colonialists.

## Asia and Western Dominance

In Central Asia the demonstration of the dominance of the Russians was very prevalent, as they sought to regain the steppes from the nomads that lived there. If we then direct our attention to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian regions we can observe that British colonials moved in large numbers to these islands and exported large amounts of the wealth they produced to Europe and North America. Hawaii quickly became an important puzzle piece in the imperial world due to its prime location between the Americas and Asia, and it eventually was taken by the United States and was used as just another source of wealth in the American Empire.

## Imperialism and Latin America

The new age of imperialism penetrated all places and this included Latin America, were the presence of railroads and imperialistic trade, as great amounts of North American and British businesses began opening their doors and establishing locations in Latin America. This continual expansion lead to various tensions existing between the people of Latin America, resulting in the Spanish-American War, which was settled quickly and in the United States favor. After North America took control of Central America regions, they tended to extend their political influence and decision making into the areas as well, protecting them from outside powers and other issues.

## The World Economy and the Global Environment

As the economic markets of the imperialist empires became more demanding the need for diverse sources of raw materials became apparent, and countries such as England began expanding themselves and investing in worldly affairs in order to compensate for hiccups with bigger economies, leading to a sense of industrialization all around the globe. As needs grew even further, the environment of the world changed as whole, while tea and other plants and crops were being moved all over the globe, to India, to Java, and everywhere in between in an attempt to quench Europe's constant hunger.

## Diversity and Dominance: Two Africans Recall the Arrival of the Europeans

When the Europeans arrived in Africa they tended to reform the local governments to better fit the model of the European governments of home, as they quickly performed actions such as banning slavery and making sure that everyone was payed in monetary currency. In addition, European governments attempted to give all people of the new regions their human rights which meant that normal chief and subject lifestyles were quickly destroyed. The people of villages were not accustomed to the new Europeans which were attempting to reform their society, instead of fighting it. Different peoples had different experiences as in the Congo, the French soldiers tended to be violent to the local populations. 

## Environment and Technology: Imperialism and Tropical Ecology

Britain had an unquenchable thirst for a range of products that it could not produce in its own cold, non fertile region. This lead to the revelation by Europeans that if they wanted more resources they were going to have to expand their number of importing regions. One of the ways this was accomplished was by smuggling the valuable seeds of the exporters into new regions such as India where they could be produced in larger amounts for their European customers.

## Conclusion

After the Industrial Revolution countries were able to spread and conquer other empires, such as when the Suez Canal was created, demonstrating the power of states to change even nature. Another consequence of the power of the industrialized states was that they felt the need to micromanage other peoples who were not a part of their country. The countries of the past who failed to evolve and adopt the new ways of industry where conquered and replaced with the colonies of the larger superpowers.

# Reflection

words {

Raw: One of the major driving forces for the expansion of these imperialistic empires was the need for cheap materials. For example, Britain was continually attempting to acquire new territories for its insatiable hunger for manufacturing.

Imperialism: The obvious focus of this chapter, imperialism began to control the globe during this chapter and no country was safe as the industrialized power houses swept the globe and took control of remote locations.

Economy: Tying into the need for raw materials to quench Britain's thirst, the economy was a motivator and a controller that swayed political opinions when it came to the take over of other people's lands. It lead to the rationalizing of conquest in the name of civilized society.
