# The Crisis of Imperial Order, 1900 - 1929

## Origins of the Crisis in Europe and the Middle East

It's important to note the fast downfall of the Ottoman Empire and their movement from being one of the most powerful richest and most powerful nations, to being the "sick man of Europe." One of the problems that European and Middle Eastern countries also faced was faults in their alliances that lead to distrust among themselves, and only to act as a catalyst, the widespread nationalism gave people even more reason to express their anger against those who did belong to the same culture that they did, making less then equals. When small quarrels in small towns got out of hand, they were quickly taken up by the great powers such as Germany and Great Britain, creating conflict across the globe.

## The "Great War" and the Russian Revolutions, 1914 - 1918

The Western Front of Germany was continually being protected from powers such as the Russians and the French, both countries that were very keen on winning their battles to improve an internal sense of nationalism. One of the problems with these consistent ad continuing wars that made very little progress and therefore produced very little funds for the fighting countries, was that they had to spend the little money they earned plus any of their other funds on supporting their armies with food and weaponry, crippling the higher nations. The all to famous Ottoman Empire also had a role in the European chaos, as the created an alliance with the Germans and proceeded to export huge numbers of Armenians when they believed that Armenian people were a threat and pro-Russian, and while they were exported many died, awarding the event the name "The Armenian Genocide." Finally conflicts were being put to an end, as Germany nearly pushed into the core of Britain, The United States responded and brought large numbers of their own troops to come and push back the Germans, who eventually stopped their fighting and mutinied their members of power.

## Peace and Dislocation in Europe, 1919 - 1929

The war had severe impacts all over the globe, from the many great and powerful European nations to the Middle Eastern states to the U.S. of A., as the death count of the war rose above 20 million, as well as large amounts of environmental destruction. After the war, Europe began to realize that it needed to have better protections put in place in their regions if they wanted to prevent a war of this magnitude from occurring again, leading them to creating the League of Nations, which passed the Treaty of Versailles, which put a debt on Germany and destroyed their power, setting the people up for strong annoyance later in history. In Russia, the country was on a severe downhill path and the current leader Lenin, decided to pass the New Economic Policy, which gave Russia a mostly free market, significantly improving their economy and their production of goods, as well as the mood of the citizens. This time of peace in Europe lasted for a very small amount of time, as Germany began creating pacts with Russia, in an attempt to build up its power once again.

## China and Japan: Contrasting Destinies

China was suffering dearly during a majority of this time period, not only did it have a weak government and a weak economy, it also suffered from natural disasters and a neglect to try and prevent them from destroying land and people. Japan on the other hand was excelling extremely quickly in the field of industry, faster than any other nation in the entire world, as they adopted many modern technologies such as electricity. Due to the very poor conditions of China, a revolution once again came to power and this time Yat-sen was the first leader as a general of China mutinied and agreed to support the new government.

## The New Middle East

China, seeing the quick movement and advancement of the communist system of Russia, decided to adopt the system for themselves, but they were subject to terrible corruption as in their defeat the nation of Turkey rose quickly under the rule of Mustafa Kemal, who created awesomely fast reforms and modeled Turkey after European nations. It's important to mention the Mandate System which was a large part of the new and emerging smaller colonial states, because it made it mandatory for them to establish ways similar to their parent countries in order to maintain a healthy population, both physically and mentally.

## Society, Culture, and Technology in the Industrialized World

After the war, the countries of Europe had opportunity for even more national changes to occur, one of those large national changes included the leveling of the class system, as the war destroyed many of the aristocrats and the nobles, leaving a space available for the middle-class to occupy the majority, instead of the minority, or just being mixed in along with the poor. An important name to know is that of Albert Einstein, a scientist of the time period who helped to develop the general theory of relativity, a staple of physics, and the math behind the first atomic bomb. Continuing on the trend of discovery and innovation, we can shift our focus to a set of brothers from America, the Wright Brothers, most famously known for their invention of the first aircraft that could be steered and was heavier than air. The largest environmental pitfalls associated with technology was located within the urban and suburban setting, where inefficient automobiles that burned hydrocarbons were ever more present.

## Diversity and Dominance: The Middle East After World War I

After the war that resulted in the seizing of the lands of the Ottomans, people had to make a decision about what was to be done with the land, and people of different backgrounds had widely varying views. An example of one of these options that British prematurely attempted to use was giving lands away, such as Palestine and Israel to the Jewish community, something that could've down with better informing. Woodrow Wilson, the president of the United States at the time was very concerned with putting the U.S. in a good light, so he decided to send a message to Europe that described the U.S.'s concern with the allocation of the Middle East, and expressed a fairly pro-independence view for the small and evolving countries. The final document is from one of the new states, Syria, which is desperately asking their European higher ups if they would just leave the region to the Syrian's own decision making.

## Environment and Technology: Cities Old and New

The cities of the time period were no longer just expanding their edges and their boarders to accommodate the new residents, no, instead they were modernizing. As the images of Cairo show in this section, the British were making great imperialist movements inside of the Middle East, and the fruits of their efforts were new cities that demonstrated the modern views of the Western Europeans. We observe how European building and European customs are being continuously implemented within the city, such as European quarters and expensive hotels for visitors, something that was not a normal aspect of Cairo's culture.

## Conclusion

The Great War was a source of great change in this chapter and this lead to reforms not only in Europe but in the Middle East and Asia as well. Europeans began seeing the need for a system that could control and keep the numerous European powers all in check with each other, something that has been a constant issue for centuries. In the Middle East, the regions were being politically torn apart as imperialist peoples and values flooded the cultural locations and proved to be great enough influences that they separated into smaller states and began allocating their power to the European powers that initialized them. Finally if we look towards Asia we see Japan, a benefiter of the war, as they quickly joined the allies and when they did they readily accepted the economic wealth and benefits generated from the war in order to stimulate their own economy.

# Reflection

words {

War: The three words here sound a little clich√© but its very important to note the impact of the Great War specifically, which not only included the pushing down of Germany's power in the long run, but also the utter destruction of the lands that connected these various European states, as the countries used shells and modern weaponry, whilst hiding in trenches.

Peace: Even with the presence of the war in this chapter, peace was just as important as just how a rainbow can arrive after a thunderstorm, after a war people either become tired or they become even more restless, in our case it was a combination as Germany supposedly fit in with the rest of Europe for several years, still being crippled by their debt, but then they made deals with the Russians, once again putting the Germans in the criminal spotlight.

Change: Finally, change is a word that should always be mentioned, just due to its prevalence in the universe as a general fact. But if you needed more proof then Russia and Japan are the powers you should be looking at. Russia went through both a severe political and economic change, as they displaced rulers and instituted new economic systems such as N.E.P. While Japan was becoming even more successful than ever as Japan began making contributions to the global industry and began using the global industry as well.
