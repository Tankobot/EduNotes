#New Civilizations in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, 2200 - 250 B.C.E. 

##Early China, 2000 - 221 B.C.E. 

China was very mountainous but was also home to large rivers where, in southern China, populations were able to grow rapidly by producing large amounts of rice. We move onto the Shang, who are consdered now, by most Chinese as barabarians even thought they upheld many large cities, controlled massive amounts of people through adminstrative power, and established far-reaching networks of trade. The SHang were eventually overtaken by the Zhou who instuted an idea called The Mandate of Heaven to justify their power, although their government form was then replaced by legalism. Confucianism became greatly more popular than Legalism and Daoism because of its concept of a hierarchical government. The last piece of this section described the concept of **yin** and **yang** and how they sometimes represented males and females in equality, but later letting the male yin become dominant. 

##Nubia, 3100 B.C.E - 350 C.E. 

Nubia was a stretch of the Nile Valley that was home to large amounts of resources such as gold,coppr, and semi-precious stones, leading it to interaction with Egypt. Because of Nubia's valuable resources trade was common and Nubian peoples would drive up the cost of the goods, leading to Egypt inserting themselves to remove the middlemen. A kingdom name Kush arose in Nubia and Egypt eventually took control of the kingdom and dominated the area's resources through power and assimilation of the Nubian peoples. Egypt fell to Nubian rulers who maintained most of the same policies and cultures of Egyptians, while also improving the standing of Nubian ideas. Finally, the section concludes by stating the larger roles that Meroitic women rulers maintained, and Meroe eventually collapsed due to Nomads and a loss of trade with the Roman Empire. 

##First Civilizations of the Americas: The Olmec and Chavin, 1200 - 250 B.C.E. 

The first peoples in the Americas are believed to have immigrated from China many years ago and continued to populate these areas, eventually developing trade and communication between geological borders, leading to the first civilizations in the Americas. One of the first influential civilizations was the Olmec who grew high calorie crops, built large scale buildings, and were able to use religion as a method to direct the labor required to perform and complete these demonding projects. The Elite of the Olmec were highly respected and depended on religious life in order to control the complex society. The section moves its focus towards South America, home to an urban civilization named Chavin that was the home of many crops, trade, and great works (using Llamas, the first domesticated beast of burden). To conclude, like the Olmec, the Chavin used religion as a method of organizing their society which worked on projects and produced many highly refined products that affecteed the region for a great period after. 

##Diversity and Dominance: Hierarchy and Conduct in the Analects of Confucius 

We talk of Confucius and his teachings. To summarize, *ren* is the ability in all human beings to do good, life is a hiearchy, and the Analects provide a method to "living a proper, honorable, virtuous, useful, and satisfying life." Ren is what every one should use as their method of acting in daily life. The hierarchy that Confucius is describing is two parts filial and one part societal. The filial parts describe the relations in a local area as seniority first, male second, and finally class. The societal part is completely made up of class structure, with higher classes deserving greater respect than lower classes. 

##Environment + Technology: Divination in Ancient Societies 

Divination is the method by which people aquire information from divine entities or gods. In many of the societies we're talking about, it was common for people of higher status to associate themselves with devine powers in order to provide explanation concerning phenomena to the rest of society. Oracle bones were a common method, along with astrology for providing predictions about coming events. In some societies, the women of a family were considered oracles, and would make predictions on subjects such child naming and the cures to illness. This section describes divination as a technology since it was actually a development for the society that helped them to put an understanding to the randomness associated with the world. 

##Conclusion 

China has had numerous forms of government and has continually produced food in there harsh geography. Nubia, as well as many other civilizations, were able to control trade routes and large resource heavy areas in order to increase the wealth of the upper-class. The Olmec and Chavin were both civilizations experienced in the art of gathering labor in order to build monumental structures. Over and over again, we see religion being used as a tool to control society and organize them to benefit for the prestigious class. Finally, we notice how many of these civilizations built large civic centers in order to strengthen the presence of their society and culture in the area. 

#Reflection 

words {
	divination: Divination fits to describe this chapter because of how prevelant the subject was in each of these civilizations towards the society being able to understand in their own way natural phenomena. 
	caste: Caste makes sense in this chapter since the caste uses divination as a way to ensure their own position in their caste. 
	charisma: The word charisma has been chosen because it is at the root of any good ruler. Charisma is what allowed many of these rulers from these civilizations the ability to organize a work force to build projects.
