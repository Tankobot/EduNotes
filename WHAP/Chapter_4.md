#Greece and Iran, 1000 - 30 B.C.E. 

##Ancient Iran, 1000 - 500 B.C.E. 

Iran location provided it with little water, which needed to be transported underground down from the mountains to prevent it from evaporating, and Iran had many resources of minerals and wood nearby to use as fuel that allowed the people living there to create and trade crafted goods, while maintaining a low population density and rare surplus of food. The Persian empire emerged from Iran and switched hands a few times before arriving at Darius I who started multiple projects for the Persians. The king of the Persians had multiple wives and recieved tribute from the provinces, which allowed the adminstration to acquire large amounts of land and advertise the benefits of being loyal to the king. The Persian religion was Zoroastrianism and it was one of the first monotheistic religion and gave power to the current ruler and may have inspired and contributed towards religions such as Judaism and Christianity. 

##The Rise of the Greeks, 1000 - 500 B.C.E. 

The geology in Greece was very tough for collecting supplies and gathering multiple resources, so they depended heavily on sea transportation to move resources between different areas connected to the Aegean Sea. The Greeks experienced a short period of isolation but quickly gained contact with the Phoenicians leading to the development of the first alphabet which allowed a much larger ratio of the population to be at least semi-literate, allowing for agoras and other places where people could discuss the commmands of their leaders. To touch a little on multiple points, Greeks had hoplites, efficient blocks of soldiers, coinage, democracy and occasionally tyrants, and a large collection of gods for controlling phenomena and human aspects. Greece was the home to many complex ideas such as challenges to religion, the idea of physics, and the idea of cause and effect in history. Sparta had the strongest and most organized army in Greece per person and helped Athens to expel tyrants in times of need, although eventually taking Athens. 

##The Struggle of Persia and Greece, 546 - 323 B.C.E. 

Greece civilizations experienced excruciating war with the Persian Empire, although they resisted and eventually formed the Delian League, lead by Athenians, and were able to force out the Persians and protect most Greek city-states. 

##Diversity and Dominance 

We learn about how Darius carved himself and an inscription on the side of a cliff that describes how he has been bestowed with all of his power by the Zoroastrian god. It then describes how the Zoroastrian god is responsible for the continuous victories of Darius. Eventually Darius's son Xerxes inscribes a message for himself that followd the same format as his father. 

##Environment + Technology 

Farmers of Greece used signs from their environment in order to make predictions and schedule jobs. This section is about a specific farmer who is describing the signs to look for in order to know what process to attend to. The signs include phenomena such as constellations and their movement across the sky, blooming of plants, and changes in the atmosphere (clouds, etc.).
