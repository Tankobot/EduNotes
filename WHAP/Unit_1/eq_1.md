Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents. 

1. The Neolithic revolution occurred after the Paleolithic revolution. Because of this later date, the Neolithic period was the adoption of agriculture and advanced tools of metal. The Paleolithic period was the adoption of primitive tools and the appearance of larger brained humans capable of completing more complex task, such as cooking. 

2. The surplus production of agriculture allows for the population of societies to increase along with their population density. More importantly, it allowed for people to take up jobs other than farming in a process of specialization. 

3. The controversy that exists with the term of civilization is the level of sophistication and the type of sophistication required or expected. For example, civilization was often characterized as the performance of Caucasians rather than the general structure of a government. 

4. The basic traits of a civilization include agriculture and cities containing administration that extends control over the civilization. There are a handful of other traits but I feel that these two are the most essential since agriculture leads to immobilization of peoples and the administration allows for the organized completion of public projects. 

5. They relied on agriculture for their economies and they had organized governments. These governments were usually occupied by kings but were often enforced with the backing of religion through divination. 

6. Writing was initially developed as a way to record religious texts and as a way to keep track of the economy. Governments became better at tracking resources in their societies as numeral systems developed. It should be noted that even without complex numeral systems they were able to track amounts of items through repeated symbols. 

7. I believe that the Indus Valley Civilizations can be categorized mostly as urbanized. For example, they used rectangular city designs which are very efficient and a common aspect of modern urban cities today. They also developed methods of metallurgy which marks them as one of the societies able to produce materials such as bronze, which can only exist in Urban environments which are able to foster the specialization required by smiths. 

8. Rivers and floodplains offered civilizations the nutrients they required to irrigate their farm. Without the rivers, the farms could become too salty and the crops trying to be grown their would die. Floods prevented this by rinsing and replenishing the soil with fertility. 

9. The Middle East is considered the birthplace of civilization as it the location where the earliest signs of agriculture, they key ingredient of civilizations. The continent which the Middle East is located on is Asia, although it should be noted that the origins of modern humans is thought to be Africa. 

10. I think Hammurabi's code was significant for acting as an insight into the lives of his civilization. This view is justified because the laws the code instituted weren't impressive compared with the governments that were already being developed in other areas of the world like Greece and the Assyrian Empire later. 

11. Agriculture depended on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. They were the only rivers in the area that was Mesopotamia. The farmers of the area built canals in order to irrigate their field with the river's essential life. The rivers also had a tendency to flood which caused mass damage to fields but also replenished the soil. 

12. They weren't a unified people because it was rare for single rulers to establish long periods of control over the entirety of Mesopotamia. Instead consistent conflict was endured in the area with cities having patron gods and the people's challenging the strength of other's gods. 

13. My personal opinion was that the Egyptians were more religious. An example of this was the pharaoh, which many Egyptians believed was divine. But that's not all, they were so connected with their religion that despite the Pharaoh Akhenaten's attempt to institute his own religion, the Egyptian belief system before snapped back into place. 

14. Conquest was a key feature of many societies like the Egyptians and the Mesopotamian civilizations as it provided a hefty amount of income and workforce for the winning state. Therefore conquest was usually a profitable endeavor. 

15. I personally believe that geography was a greater factor in Mesopotamian civilizations as their cities and populations were dependent and built around their water sources. The geographical feature that is the most important for agriculture, besides arable land. Religion on the other hand, although influencing the power of governments was common theme that didn't distinctly set the Mesopotamians apart. 

16. I think that nearly all civilizations are similar to each in a greater ratio than their differences. And Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley civilizations are no different. They all shared a common goal, to expand and control larger areas, to build standing structures, and to control economy flows. 

17. The Mesopotamian's had a larger diversity contributed by the fact that they controlled less distinct boundaries and did practice the idea of nationalism as strongly as Egypt. The Egyptian people were fairly isolated in terms of demographics and they had regular disputes locally. 

18. I believe that the Pharaoh was a greater leader in religion than in politics since his actions were justified because of his deity like position. The Pharaoh had less opposition because of the fact that he was generally considered to be making actions on part of a god and that his actions were not mistakes. 

19. My teachers (unspecific on who) from the past would be considered by myself to be the most Pharaoh like. Let me explain, they make decisions that have a local dictator's power with them because of their position, and the majority of the people interacting with the teacher accept his/her decisions as perfect because of the knowledge they are implied to have. 

20. They both list key points and topics that the every person should follow. And in the same sense that Ma'at judged souls traveling to the afterlife, staff at the school uphold the rules in the agenda judging whether students are allowed to proceed normally with their education. 

21. I think that Harappa and Irvine do share characteristics. They both have a government that makes local laws for the people, although Irvine is controlled in a decentralized manner by higher powers residing in other parts of California and D.C. They both share in the pursuit of arts, as Irvine has citizens of a high enough class in order to pursue such subjects. 

22. The agricultural revolution caused large amounts of conflict because it allowed for individuals to have greater amounts of possessions. This lead others to want these possessions, and now you see the issue. Common principle, "I want what they have." This leads to clashes between both individuals and groups where one side has something that the other wishes to possess. 

23. The agricultural allowed for the surplus of foods to be generated and this food was produced by farmers. Now people could specialize and generate a greater income using the economy supplied by the farmers and other sources. Farmers could hire slaves. These are the reasons why class distinctions became so prevalent. Agriculture enabled people to uphold different jobs in society. 

24. Jared Diamond believed that the agricultural revolution was a mistake because it allowed for the previously stated class-distinction, greater inequality of genders, less free time for the common individual, and an inspiration of all levels of crime due to the lopsided ratio of material ownership dispersed amongst the population. 

25. In general and so far, it's difficult to say for the better, so I'll say it was for the worst. Women lost many of the rights they previously shared with men as men became the workers of society and as they generated an income, this convinced them that they were contributing more to a family then the woman. Men believed that women cared for the children and maintained the house, but they brought the resources that made the life of their family possible, so they were considered of greater importance. 

26. The agricultural revolution definitely had a negative impact on the environment. This is demonstrated through the creation of farms that destroyed natural plants and wildlife. In order to create space for many of these farms farmers would perform techniques such as slash and burn in order to shave the landscape quickly and with little labor. The environment was being changed by the humans, to fit the humans, a theme we see still in greater effect today.
