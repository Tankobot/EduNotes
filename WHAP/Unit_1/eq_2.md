1. Political power was distributed between the different classes. For example, the warrior aristocracy held a majority of the power while the lower-class peasants had very little power and a small range of influence on their leaders. The warrior elite were able to maintain there higher position through strength and intimidation. 

2. Aristocracy played a large role during their conquest because the aristocracy decided what culture would be pushed upon the newly conquered peoples. The aristocracy also contributed to conquest being more commmon as they encouraged for conquest to occur.

Religious temples and shrines were built inside the city and most cities were even orientated in a certain fashion in order to aline with the cardinal directions. 

4. The development of writing allowed the Shang government to better control their civilization. Only the elite of the society were able to read and write, as the writing system contained hundreds of characters and pictograms. 

5. Agriculture in China differed because first off all the main crop was rice, insted of wheat or barley. Secondly, the Chinese had plentiful amounts of water that continually saturated the soil which grew the rice, while in places such as Mesopotamia and Egypt, water was scarce and they heavily depended on the few rivers.

9. The Mandate of Heaven was an idea that originated from the Zhou concerning rulers. It stated that a ruler could only rule when he had the Mandate of Heaven, if he made poor decisions and was successfully overthrown, he must have lost the Mandate of Heaven at some point. It affected Chinese rulers because it made them more responsible for their actions, as the public would feel obligated to rebel if they thought that the current ruler was not worthy. 

10. The Warring States period impacted China by leading to the development of belief systems such as Daoism and Confucianism. When China was eventually reunited, these new beliefs were adopted and modified. 

11. Legalism is the belief that the law has the highest authority, higher than the government.
