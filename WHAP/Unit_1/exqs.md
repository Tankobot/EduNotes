#Extra Questions 

##What impact did diffusion and diasporas have during this era? 

Diffusions allowed for the slow movement of culture between societies. More importantly, what made it different from diasporas, was that it allowed for a higher chance that the culture would be adopted as it was slow and steady. Diasporas on the other hand had either large impacts or nonexistent ones. This is because, the movement of a culture directly into new areas is either squashed by competitive opposition, or adopted quickly in order to diffuse the culture. An example of diasporas can be seen with the Assyrians who took advantage of diasporas in order to weaken the people they conquered by dispersing them throughout their empire, instead of putting them in one place.

##Why is it accurate to state that the term civilized is a biased term? 

It is accurate to state that its a biased term because over the centuries it has been used to describe people who follow the traits listed above. Anyone who was uncivilized was considered inferior because they didn't conform to the methodology that made for powerful societites. Instead, they were nomadic and were considered barabrians who didn't stand on the same ground as their civilized counterparts. Civilized is a biased word because we, the people who are describing it, come from the perspective that would benefit from the word having a positive connotation instead of a negative one. Therefore it is impossible for us to judge the word on a fair playing ground since it describes ourselves.
