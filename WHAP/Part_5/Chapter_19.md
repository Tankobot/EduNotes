# Southwest Asia and the Indian Ocean, 1500 - 1750

## The Ottoman Empire, to 1750

The Ottomans eventually controlled one of the largest Muslim empires the world had ever seen and Suleiman the Magnificent played a large role by applying pressure on Europe while putting the Ottoman Empire into a golden age. A key part of the Ottoman Empire that allowed them to expand was their military force which was subsidized by methods of converting conquered Christian boys into soldiers for the empire called "Janissaries." This system only worked for so long as inflation hit the state hard, and due to religious reasons taxes could not be increased, resulting in a lack a government purchase power. Although the Ottoman Empire's economy never matched that of the European economy they still had multiple influential events such as the Tulip Period which helped to shape their markets during their lifespan.

## The Safavid Empire, 1502 - 1722

Early in the history of the Sufavid Empire the new leader Ismail convinced his populations to abandon their previous Sunni beliefs and instead adopt the beliefs of Shi'ite Islam. This separated the area of Iran from all of its neighbors who were commonly Sunnis and this contrast of beliefs lead to interesting interactions between these peoples. Shah Abbas I, one of the leaders of Iran, relocated the capital of Iran to Isfahan and this new city lead a generally separate lifestyle from that of its predecessor, Istanbul. Due to a lack of productivity from Iran's economy and the materials that they produced, the state had difficulties in supplying the funds necessary to support their military.

## The Mughal Empire, 1526 - 1761

The Mughal Empire was primarily Muslim and this caused great issues when the state attempted to expand their empire into regions of India where Hindu belief was extremely resistant to the replacement of their ideas. The Mughal Empire had its origins in that of Turks but eventually moved its interests into India and adopted government styles such as promising salaries to people based on rank rather than relationship. The invading Muslim thought created tension between Islam and Hinduism but these creases were slowly smoothed and the creation of Sikhism helped to solidify a neutral area of belief. The Mughal Empire eventually experienced severe decline after it failed to maintain tabs on all of its regional powers and they accumulated enough power to destroy the empire in all but name.

## Trade Empires in the Indian Ocean

The Mughals, Safavids, and Ottomans were all subject to the problems that are brought by the lack of maritime expansion or use, while European peoples continued to lead the economic race by expanding maritime and using new forms of business such as joint-stock companies. Trade in the Indian ocean brought Islam to the East Indies and Islam here was generally separated from the Islam beliefs practiced in the Middle East, leading to events such as female rulers, until more Islamic views were brought into these regions. Muslims also migrated into East Africa leading to the development of culture, such as the Swahili language, and monopolies that became more expansive in the maritime world.

## Diversity and Dominance: Islamic Law and Ottoman Rule

Judging based on information provided by Ebu Su'ud, you can gain a good understanding of the legal views of the Ottoman Empire. He describes how the Ottoman's have very little tolerance for believers of other faiths that live in the Venetians in Crete, giving a look into Ottoman religious cooperation. The Ottomans also have affairs in creating conflict between themselves and the Shi'ites that live in Iran. They also maintained strict laws on the consumption of substances such as coffee which was associated with game playing. The same methodology follows for subjects such as thievery, which are based on previous associations.

## Environment and Technology: Metal Currency and Inflation

Metal was the normal material for creating currency before the nineteenth century. The Ottoman Empire and areas such as Iran depended upon the worth of their currency to maintain itself due to their small amount of mining and consumption. A serious problem occurred once Spain settled in the New World since precious metals were produced in mass quantities from Spain and this severely dropped the value of coins in the other regions. This destroyed the worth of people who received pay by a fixed number. When the value of coinage plummeted, so did the income of so many workers.

## Conclusion

The Empires discussed in this chapter concerned themselves primarily with the mass expansion of their regions and not with their economies. Europe was excelling in terms of economy. With the new innovations such as joint-stock companies, people could fund large expeditions while sharing the risk of failure. The governments of the Ottomans, Mughals, and Safavids relied on techniques such as land grant that just weren't able to supply the taxes the government needed.

# Reflection

words {

Islam: Islam was a key part of this chapter as different empires adopted different branches of Islam, this created large amounts of tension between peoples which would otherwise be able to live together mutually.

Expense: The various states discussed in this chapter all had issues with managing their expenses. As their empires increased in size, their militaries did as well. Like any other form of labor, the government spent its taxes on these branches, leaving no room for cushioning their economies.

Income: A large part of the downfall of these empires was due to the methods by which they collected taxes. The most common method was through the use of land grants which produced a specific amount over a period of time. Once Spain began producing tons of precious metal, the price of local currencies plummeted until people could no longer be supported by previous fixed rates.
