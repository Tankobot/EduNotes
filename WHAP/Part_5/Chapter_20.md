# Northern Eurasia, 1500 - 1800

## Japanese Reunification

In the 12th century Japan's government relied upon a system of rulers called daimo which controlled their own armies and pledged themselves to Japan's emperor who in reality held little actual power for himself but instead acted as figure head. Eventually a set of leaders named the Tokugawa Shogunate rose to prominence in Japan and are famous for their ability to improve Japan's economic systems which included roads and other trade and communication routes. The Japanese tended to isolate themselves from other peoples besides the Chinese and this lead to hostility towards popular European traditions like those of Christianity. After the 1700s the position of the Samurai in Japan slowly went on a decline as they lost money to Japan's rising economy and the fluctuation of the price of rice in Japan.

## The Later Ming and Early Qing Empires

The Ming Empire was popular around the world for both their cultural and commercial success, as European expeditions expressed their amazement with Ming cities which contained large buildings and the foundation for porcelain production. This era of economic success was eventually brought to an end as the Qing rose to power due to the Ming's inability to maintain their large military to protect themselves from Mongols and other invaders. To add on to China's events was the rising popularity of Taiwan as a center for trade especially with Europe even though it was consistently pushing European influences away. Qing emperors such as Kangxi were known for their ability to better manage the economy and government services and therefore China began to thrive with great improvements being made to things such as roads and waterworks which looked favorable in the eyes of Western Europeans who eventually brought many European ideas to China through the Jesuits. Over time China's population boomed yet it still maintained strict laws against trade with foreign countries and because of this Europeans continued to become frustrated with Chinese trade.

## The Russian Empire

The Russians came from Slavic peoples and were at one point controlled by the Golden Horde, a Mongol khanate, and they are known for their leaders who go under the title tsar which is a reference to the great Roman leader Julius Caeser. Tensions were generally very high in Russia due to its connections with such a wide variety of cultures, the varying belief systems that existed were consistently at ends with each other. After a long period of extended isolation from other world powers such as Europe and China, a tsar named Peter the Great made changes that brought Russia closer and connected more tightly with Europe and European powers while still maintaining their distance from China. After Russia continued its expansion into more Eastern territories it crossed the strait between modern day Russia and Alaska and started trading monopolies that began moving Alaskan furs outside of the Americas and into the growing country of Russia.

## Comparative Perspectives

China and Russia and well known for their amazing ability to expand their empires with great speed that exposed new economic opportunities, while European countries if you exclude Spain, tended to focus more on their local trading and not on exploration. Japan is a very unique case because of how far it went in order to maintain isolation from other peoples even other East Asian peoples like the Chinese, this was both a benefit because it gave them a more unique culture, and a detriment because it limited their economic options. Almost all of the countries we have discussed have also been the regions were greater social toleration became prevalent due to the desire to assimilate more peoples while Japan continued to be the odd man out. While places such as China were highly regarded for their acceptance of new belief systems such as that of Christianity, Russia was known for their continued tensions between various cultures.

## Environment and Technology: East Asian Porcelain

Porcelain was an art that was not only limited to Japan but places such as China and Korea too. The most common colors of porcelain were blue and white and the pottery was known for its glaze. As cheaper porcelain became a common export of East Asian countries their economies began to benefit from the increased demand of this material to Europe. One of the most common purchasers of both Chinese and Japanese porcelain was the Dutch East India company which brought thousands of pieces of fine pottery to Europe.

## Diversity and Dominance: Gendered Violence: The Yangzhou Massacre

This account from a primary source describes in detail how unprepared the Qing were for the invasion of one of their center cities. The account also describes the brutality and lack of decency that the invading peoples had for the members of society who currently lived in the city. The narrator was only able to survive by hiding away for as long as possible until he could flee.

## Conclusion

Japan is a country which because of its isolation is known for it very harmonious culture that pushes away new cultures and has been affected mostly through internal affairs. China on the other hand is famous for its connections with other Asian countries whether it is through trade or through warfare, dynasty after dynasty has had to deal with the dilemmas of interconnected states. Russia maintained good outside connections but their primarily Christian orthodox faith has limited their association and assimilation of other cultures due to the various tensions between the separate faiths that existed within Russia during the time period. What all of these have in common is their connection to Western Civilization either directly or indirectly.

# Reflection

words {

Christianity: Christianity played a major role in this chapter as Jesuits from Western Europe migrated towards the Asian countries bringing with them their religious ideas and faith and attempting to make converts in these new regions.

Reaction: As it is partly related to Christianity in regards to Western Europe, the Asian countries discussed in this chapter tend to always have mixed feelings towards Europeans and Christianity. This is likely due to the fact that Christianity is infamous in its common theme of pushing itself onto others usually in a harsh manner leading to ill emotions.

Evolution: Evolution in the sense of culture and the Darwinian principles played a major role in the development of each country discussed in this chapter. China cycled through multiple dynasties from the Ming to the Qing, bringing with them new governments. And, Japan, being as isolated as it was, dealt with its own consistently changing internal government affairs between Shoguns who carried all the power and emperors who acted as political figures only.
