# The Atlantic System and Africa, 1550 - 1800

## Plantations in the West Indies

The West Indies were eventually populated by large numbers of both Europeans and Africans as well as the native populations. Spanish peoples brought crops such as sugar cane that pushed out the current crop growing there, which was tobacco, and dominated the markets of the Atlantic in terms of produce. In order to increase and promote products from the West Indies, charter companies were given complete monopolies over certain trading routes and they used this power to bring Europeans across the ocean in return for work. European companies soon realized that the use of African slave labor was cheaper than fellow Europeans, leading cities such as Barbados to create large plantations where slaves produced sugars. Along with great mortality, the use of Europeans almost took over the use of slaves, but since the price of lands in these areas went up, Europeans who agreed to go to the Caribbean could no longer afford to take the trip and hope to prosper after their work terms.

## Plantation Life in the Eighteenth Century

Sugar was very popular due to its easy harvesting and regrowth, but required a factory in order to refine the sugar into a resource that could be better transported and was worth more in Europe. Although most of the plantations made good use of their own resources and recycled their goods, they also contributed to the destruction of soils and the massive deforestation of local lands. Plantations were controlled by a very small number of Europeans who made each plantations plantocracy, which made decisions on the part of all the members of the region living on the plantation. Slaves were usually organized into groups which were headed by other stronger slaves and slaves that resisted the order of their higher ups were given serious punishments in order to help ensure cooperation. Social hierarchy was strictly enforced in these new plantations and the general rules put whites above blacks even when both of the people in question were free and not slaves.

## Creating the Atlantic Economy

These plantations were the foundation of the new and emerging Atlantic economy, being facilitated by the consistent movement of ships to and from the Americas, to and from Europe, carrying a combination of sugar and slaves. Through the combined use of capitalism and mercantilism, Europe was able to maximize profits by giving investors easy access to investment opportunities that benefited both European imperial powers and the merchants within their borders. The Atlantic Circuit was a path that continually moved goods such as sugars and slaves to and from the Americas, while also allowing single voyages to create multiple points for increased profits. Slaves experienced very poor treatment and efforts during their long transports across the Atlantic to what would be their new home, and the journey scarred many Africans before they arrived.

## Africa, the Atlantic, and Islam

Surprisingly, although it is under consistent historical debate, African slavers also made profits by catching other Africans and bartering them over to European slavers for manufactured goods fro Europe. Slaves were not the only good to come out of Africa as materials such as gold and ivory also produced large amounts of wealth for the rulers of African kingdoms. The Bight of Biafra was a region were European traders and slavers could gain slaves through barter with locals for people such as debtors, victims of kidnapping, and convicted criminals. As African kingdoms acquired prisoners of war through expansion they sold these new prisoner populations to the ready Europeans. Although many African kingdoms (leaders) benefited from their interactions with Europeans, they had to deal with consistent warfare and conflict with encroaching Islamic states.

## Environment and Technology: Amerindian Foods in Africa

Foods such as potatoes from the Americas were very important in Europe for the poor that resided there. Corns spread to Africa in the forms of Maize. But an amazing food that also found its way to Africa was the Cassava plant. It was amazing because it grew well in nearly all conditions and it produced a large number of calories per unit of land.

## Diversity and Dominance: Slavery in West Africa and the Americas

Different peoples living in different parts of the old world had separate ideas concerning slavery and European and Islamic states were no different. Scholars such as a Muslim named Ahmad Baba answered many questions about slaves in his region including their life conditions. Other people such as Job Solomon were able to impress the people of Europe and were able to profit off of their knowledge of the intricacies of African slaves and systems.

## Conclusion

New systems that emerged within the Americas allowed for trading economies such as the Atlantic system to flourish between the Americas, Africa, and Europe. New forms of trade such as capitalism enabled large companies to spread their influence over more than just a single continent. Slaves were the center of this new trade, they were the center of the Atlantic system, they were the center of plantations, and they were the center for a majority of the labor throughout the Americas. These systems generated unprecedented wealth for not only the rulers of regions but for private investors as well, demonstrating the asset that the Americas were to become.

# Reflection

words{

capitalism: Capitalism is just one of the new and developing systems that gave people the ability to increase profits by sharing the risk of issues that might happen along the way.

slavery: Slavery provided the workforce needed for cheaply produced goods that the old world profited from. Inspiring a new era of extended slavery in the Americas. 

profit: Profits are the key aspect of what made the plantation in the Americas so powerful. They had the ability to generate new sums of goods worth extreme amounts in the old world.
