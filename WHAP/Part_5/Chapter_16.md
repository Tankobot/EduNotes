# Transformations in Europe, 1500 - 1750

## Culture and Ideas

The development of the printing press allowed for greater reforms in religion, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, who maintained ideas that differed from Christianity and the pope. Even with many of these splits in the Church and religious reform, a common problem that remained in Europe was persecution of men and women as being witches, causing folklore to blend with religions such as Christianity. People such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton challenged the previously held beliefs of Christianity and religious powers, but this was unable to prevent the spread of these new ideas that changed people's view of the Bible and religious scriptures. The Enlightenment was a period in which many people came to challenge established ideas about subjects such social order, instead of just physics.

## Social and Economic Life

Cities were an outstanding achievement, since pools of people living in a large city could make great profits while relying mostly on the global market and very little on local resources. After the success of the Dutch and other city based regions, new economic ideas emerged, with one being the now common "joint-stock company," which allowed for many people to share in the risk of business ventures. The poor people of Europe were faced with the most problems that resulted from the increased economy, causing massive issues with the majority of countries' populations. Women in this new modern Europe played slightly more significant roles but still did not receive rights comparable to men.

## Political Innovations

Although a few leaders and groups attempted to better unify Europe, nothing ever rose to unite the individual states and eventually the separate states normalized with the existence of each other. Often times in European states, leaders used officials and sided members to kill off anyone or anything that challenged their power or right to rule. Slowly, time and time again, Parliament gained power in England and demonstrated the positive aspects of having a government of votes while France continued to be ruled by monarchs who distracted nobles. In Europe a balance of power was developed while all of the monarchs that still existed continued to create problems in their search for higher powers. The cost of increasing each states power was supplied by the encouragement of international trade and local economies.

## Environment and Technology: Mapping the World

In 1602, maps that depicted the entire world were already in production. A map maker named Matteo Ricci produced maps for both China and Europe. The maps that he made and the maps of other were usually made with the longitude lines being made parallel to help with the navigation of sailors.

## Diversity and Dominance: Political Craft and Craftiness

People of politics continued to evolve over these hundred of years especially in the recent time periods. Politics has found that it is better to rule off of support rather than that of only force. Machiavelli wrote an essay that described how rulers should act in order to maintain a good standing among their people and it now plays a large role in how we see leaders and the actions they make. For example the queen of England once made a speech that people argue whether it was truly her thoughts, or something produced in order to better improve her image.

## Conclusion

Throughout this chapter, Europe experienced multiple revolutions, all of which concerning the ideas of the people. The new ideas that surfaced in Europe brought education and individuality to more people while also contributing towards conflicts between beliefs. Through the Europeans consistent use of shared power over the lands, they were able to effectively eliminate any one threat to Europe by acting together. All of these changes and new concepts affected Europe in times after the 16teenth century, contributing greater to modern Europe's domination.

# Reflection

words {

enlightenment: People all over Europe experienced new revolutions of thought. This further propelled individual people as well as large groups of people to challenge commonly accepted ideas. People began to gain power against predefined beliefs, allowing for new policies in already placed states.

city: The emergence of cities as the major centers of population all over Europe allowed for new economies to develop. These new economies made it profitable to run a government on products other than agriculture, leading to a reprocessing of wealth in regions all around the world.

redistribution: Unlike most places, Europe became settled in the idea that it would not be controlled by a single power. Instead it was composed of various smaller states that all contained invested interest in the well being of their region and the regions of others. This allowed for Europe and the Europeans living there to feel safe in lands of various peoples.
