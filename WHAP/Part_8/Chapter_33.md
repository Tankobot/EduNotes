# Globalization at the Turn of the Millennium

## Global Political Economics

Democracy started gaining popularity around the world because it offered a method for settling the differences that exist between various cultures that must exist under the same government and in the same region. Although many agencies and organizations such as the United Nations have made great contributions towards the peacekeeping of the world as a whole, we still see actions of ethnic cleansing in which it is common to see members of one religion or ethnicity pushing away the members of another religion or ethnicity. In addition to this, one of the modern problems that face the global powers today is the subject of weapons of mass destruction which includes weapons such as nuclear weapons which have the power to cause mass breakdown on a global scale. The upside to all of this was the improvements and innovations that were made before and during this time period, as China and other governments all around the world decided to open up their markets and after the internet, economic decisions could be made at the speed of light. The World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund have both contributed to these changes being enforced in the new economy.

## Trends and Visions

People began recognizing that this period of time that we live was the start of new age as they witnessed the invention of new cars, but more importantly, the invention and innovation of electronics such as fiber optic cables that propelled the globe forward. Christianity has always been one of the most popular and influential religions around the world, but when the millennium came to pass many Christians were convinced of its special significance and like they had in past times encouraged the conversion to their faith which lead to ill-feelings from those not keen on conversion. Due to the constant European presence all over the world as well as numerous other reasons, the Islamic faith has been associated with violence due to their resistance towards the movement of the modern world. A mark in history was the passing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which set down a standard for the world to follow in terms of the rights that are guaranteed to humans that live on planet earth. Finally, by the end of this time period women were being given equal rights all across the globe, through work not only with the United Nations, but among private people as well.

## Global Culture

Cultural imperialism is effectively the new age of imperialism as no longer do large countries impose direct imperialism upon smaller and less able nations and take advantage of them for their own benefit, instead they take advantage of them through marketing and entertainment that can be communicated across the globe. The next part of this section deals with the movement of pop culture which involves the new idea that what is popular in the media can only be popular for a very brief period of time due to the speed at which news travels. The final system of culture discussed in this section is global culture, which highlights the overwhelming presence of certain aspects of culture around the globe, such as the internationality of the English language. Even through all of this change, some cultures were able to endure the wave and places such as Japan were able to maintain some of their ancient cultures and values in the face of overwhelming adversity.

## Environment and Technology: Global Warming

It has been the topic of major debate, but it is undeniable that our world is changing. The Greenhouse Effect notes the ability of the Earth to trap the heat that comes from the sun and keep it close to the ground. It is just one of the natural processes that helps to maintain life on this planet. There has been suspicion that large scale industrialization has lead to issues related to the greenhouse effect as well as other natural processes. These effects can generate terrible consequences such as typhoon, which we have seen in places such as Bangladesh. Many world powers have taken steps to agree to work towards a solution to these problems, but they need the support of everyone, something that is extremely tough to come by.

## Diversity and Dominance: World Literature in English

Over the years, the world has seen so many languages. And we should also include languages that aren't just written but have sometimes even more complex written counterparts, I'm looking at you Chinese. With the emergence of instant communication and complete, or near complete discovery of the globe, the discovery of new languages and unique cultures is becoming more and more rare. As a consequence of this, cultures tend to settle and mellow out and mix together. In the case of language, English appears to have taken the spot as the international language of choice. In India, we have seen the effects of this sort of standardization as entertainment havens such as Bollywood begin to release films in English to account for the growing use of the language, which is already officially accepted in many parts.

## Conclusion

Our ideas about the future are ever changing and before this century began, we were believing that their was no where but up, but now that the century has begun, we have realized that that view might not be the most realistic. This is especially true when concerning new problems such as the environmental effects of industrialization. The second part of this that should be taken close note of is the movement of cultures around the world. The movement of ideas has always been present throughout recorded history, but it has ben a hallmark of the twentieth and twenty-first with the invention of and innovations attributed to the generation of electronics. For instance, these notes are being taken on a personal home computer using a complex array of transistors that convert thoughts to writing, in a metaphorical sense at least. To conclude world history, everything seems to be moving towards a giant melting pot of information, with the occasional and certain hiccups along the way.

# Reflection

words {

Economy: Many countries throughout the beginning of this millennia have scene the benefits that have resulted from the new innovations such as instant communication. Businesses and the economies of countries on opposite ends of the globe can have a close and defining interlocked relationship with one another.

Change: Having to do with the previous point, new technological change has been occurring faster now than has ever been scene in the past. With these new technologies many parts of the world have settled differences, yet we still see the conflicts between differing values.

Culture: In terms of culture, the world has begun a process of ideological trading that has woven together many different peoples and their beliefs. But it is important to point out that this has not just been a mixing but a domination of cultures, such as English which has and is quickly becoming the international language.
