# Crisis, Realignment, and the Dawn of the Post-Cold War World, 1975 - 1991

## Post-colonial Crises and Asian Economic Expansion, 1975 - 1991

In Latin America, there were consistent reforms, revolutions, and political upheavals during this specific period of time, and places such as Nicaragua were heavy pressed by influences from outside sources such as the United States to continue to support leaders that were not in the publics best interest. In the Middle East in areas such as Iran and Iraq, the greater powers of the United States and the Russians were at ends to maintain proxy wars towards each other and at the cost of the civilians and peoples living in the regions in conflict. In Asia economic expansion was also being felt by countries such as Japan which gained large amounts of economic power and looked to continue on growing if it hadn't been for the new fears of corruption between the government and industry. China eventually moved itself back into the world economy after they reformed their communist policies and they began a steady increase in production and value over time.

## The End of the Bipolar World, 1989 - 1991

In the Soviet Union its important to look at the strict polarity that existed among the government and its people, this included not only the discrimination of the Jewish population but also the strict suppression of anti-government ideas, all of which led to general anger and ill feelings in Russia. After the formation of labor powers such as the Solidarity, Russia and the other world powers recognized the movement of the public away from socialist ideas and the USSR quickly dissolved and in its place stood the Russian Republic and various other states that took the opportunity to separate and declare independence. The Persian Gulf War was a longstanding conflict between Iraq and Kuwait concerning the debts that Iraq owed to Kuwait and after they refused to lower them, Iraq launched attacks and the United States pushed their military into the region.

## The Challenge of Population Growth

Around the world populations began booming, more than they had been anyways, and there was a direct contrast that was emerging between the various types of nations, where the developed countries were creating sustaining populations while the currently developing countries were on track towards mass growth. In the developed countries people are not worried as much about raising a new family to put children into the world but have become more concerned it seems with furthering their own life and creating their own success before accomplishing a secondary goal like raising a child. In the developing countries however, where education for women is hard to come by and modern technologies such as contraception are not present, the fertility rate seems to stay in extremely high numbers. Each nation is experiencing drastic effects depending on their young to old ratios, as countries with many young people are forced to create new jobs and industry to pay them, while the countries with more old people are dealing with less production but the responsibility of caring for the population.

## Unequal Development and the Movements of Peoples

All over the world the gap that exists between the rich and the poor has been observed and it only seems to continue to grow, with the few industrialized nations gaining the majority of the wealth of the entire globe as poor nations fall behind. The migration of the populace into high density cities is an amazing phenomenon of the era with huge numbers of peoples moving away from their more rural locations and populating the cities of their nations creating new situations of crime and worsening lifestyles. Now more than ever, we witness the movements of people around the world through global migrations and the movement of peoples away from their original country and to countries such as the United States and the region of Europe, accounting for a large portion of those countries population growth.

## Technological and Environmental Change

After the World Wars, the globe underwent great technological and environmental change that were linked, with the emergence of new technologies such as the computer and new forms of communication, countries began to compete on a global level. The new technologies that were enabling the great population growths of the various countries saw large impacts on the environment with new activists then emerging and beginning to fight for the protection of the global environment as a whole. Because of these rising environmental issues, governments around the world began to enforce stronger policies of prevention and gave greater benefits to caution and improvement on the environmental front.

## Diversity and Dominance: The Struggle for Women's Rights in an Era of Global Political and Economic Change

Neo-liberalism took the world by storm, ok maybe not by storm, but it was still a very important event that found its way throughout places such as Latin America. In Latin America specifically, the neo-liberalism didn't feel like an improvement but instead it felt like yet another instance of the United States attempting to impose control over not the Untied States of America. For women, neo-liberalism had a different but no better effect, as the new companies went into these new nations and chose to employ women for cheaper pay while the women themselves were only able to keep little of what they did make and they still had to uphold the responsibilities of before, such as maintaining the children and keeping a household.

## Environment and Technology: The Personal Computer

The personal computer was an important invention that arrived after the end of World War II and would change the course of history in a big way. Electronic computing began as an obscure method of mathematics that could only be accomplished in large data centers, but it quickly became a option that nearly everyone in wealthy nations could take advantage of. Computers were small and portable, but cheap enough that they could now compete for consumer's wallets. With the advent of faster processors and the realization of the world wide web, people all around the world have access to large data sets unlike anything ever seen before.

## Conclusion

The tensions between the United States and the Russians continued to exist even into this modern era and through the use of proxy wars they were able to supposedly keep each other at bay after the Cold War and its general scares. In Latin America, the various nations began to replace their dictatorships with democracies and follow the global example. In the Middle East, their was not peace but instead new conflict as Iran and Iraq began a conflict that would create new political turmoil. Finally, the globe would undertake new changes in not only the economy, but the demographic and technology as well, with it came new environmental issues as well.

# Reflection

words {

Growth: Growth has taken many forms in this chapter. It not only refers to the general population growth of a country, but also the peoples moving to said country from other regions, and the growth of knowledge that became a reality after the conception of the world wide web and the power of industry in other regions such as East Asia. 

Innovation: Innovation contributed to this chapter by giving the various nations and the world as an entirety the ability to communicate and advance unlike almost any other time period. This includes most notably the personal computer and computing in general.

Movement: Connected to growth but still able to stand on its own, movement played a large role in this chapter as immigrants traveled all across the globe and came into developed countries, helping to give those countries not only wealth, but a growing population.
