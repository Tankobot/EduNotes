Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents.

1. The development of the Silk Road was truly made possible when new animals that could carry large amounts of weight appeared. Specifically one of the popular animals was camels who could withstand the long periods of travel that provided very little food and water.

2. The ports that were constructed for merchants were critical to the success of the Silk Road because they allowed for an easier transfer of goods and materials across large distances. To be more precise, the lower fees on trade encouraged it and cities that were run by princes such as Samarkand grew wealthy off of this trading flow, where cultural interests were diffused among both societies.

3. A wide variety of products were traded using the efficiency of the Silk Road. From the west products such as horses and grapes were sent from Rome and other western civilizations. From the east came, most popularly and where the route gets its name, silk, spices, and paper. These east Asian products were unique and kept a large pool of income drifting into Chinese civilizations.

4. The Silk Road really opened up both sides of the continent to the other sides' cultures. To elaborate, the east Asian societies were introduced to western ideas and materials such as horses. This was a very big deal, as horses became one of the most prominent animals to use during war conflicts. The western societies that occupied what would at one point become Europe and the Middle East accepted a large import of silk and spices. These were two high priced luxury items that introduced the western societies of the idea that their were profits and advantages to be taken by using this trade route.

5. The Indian Ocean Maritime System connected the Middle East, Asia, and India together and allowed for increased speedy trading.

6. We could tell that they were more advanced then their friends in the Mediterranean because they used movable sails. The Mediterranean boats either relied on ores or on sing direction sails. This was inefficient as it consumed a lot of manpower to move resources, but the triangle sailed boats of the Indian Ocean moved, they required little human input.

7. The main products that were distributed across the three areas due to this trading system included substances such as spices and tropical fruits. The most common products came from Persians and Middle Eastern peoples, and because of this their religion and cultures spread the most predominantly around the ports.

8. It allowed for the cultural diffusion of practices among sailors. These sailors could bring these new beliefs back to their native areas and cause the people in those areas to uptake these new ideas. Once the ideas were disconnected from their origin though, they could branch off with their own new beliefs.

9. The camel saddle key for the trade across the Saharan because it allowed for many camels to be used for carrying large amounts of weight. It also allowed for them to be used as war methods. Both of these uses made them great for the trade and transport required to make the Saharan trade routes prosper.

10. The main products included exotic animals and gold from Africa, olives from Italy, and miscellaneous manufactured items that were distributed from the Romans.

11. The trans-Saharan trade routs were impact-ful during the foundations period because it allowed for the spread of animals such as the camel, and the spread of cultures such as African paintings and cattle herding. The camel played the biggest role and they're what really helped to give these routes traction.

12. The great traditions were ideas and beliefs that were held by the elites of society, while small traditions were held in minor communities. The small traditions dominated because the sub-saharan cultures were isolated from one another and the small groups that existed didn't have the power to institutionalize large belief systems and government reforms.

13. The kingdoms all shared qualities that came to be known as Africanities. These traits included things such as social class. In which separate peoples were given different statuses. Even though they had kings, they never fully unified until Europeans were introduced and overruled local governments.

14. It made an amazing impact because it demonstrated the spread of iron smelting information and the complex language systems that had developed. Specifically the ones that had branched from the Bantu family. The proto=Bantu were fairly advanced and participated in activities such as fishing and harvesting.

15. Bantu allowed for many peoples to communicate with each, and more generally it allowed for communication on a local level. It also allowed for the development of iron smithing and the ability to trade their manufactured products with the rest of the known world through the use of the sub=saharan trade routes.

16. Christianity did swimmingly after its initial spreading. It took advantage of every single one of the trade routes above and allowed for a unification not yet seen by the world. Christians connected with other Christians and they obeyed common religious leaders. Images such as the pope grew in power after the introduction of Christianity in Rome.

17. Buddhism was also an interesting infestation. It spread all over the known world starting in India. It used the routes explained above but really only gained traction in its homeland and China. China accepted Buddhism and made it extremely popular and powerful as monasteries gained greater rights and privileges and eventually became to big for their power and were overthrown.

18. The most influential trading system was the Silk Road and the least influential trading system was the Indian Ocean Maritime system. Even though it hurts me to say it, the Indian Ocean Maritime trade routes were the least influential because they were adding on to what the Silk road could accomplish. It is true that they allowed trade with Africa but that isn't enough. The Silk Road is the most popular trade route and it contributed the most when it came to diffusing the cultures of China, India, Europe, and the Middle East.

19. I don't like to use the generic term *food* as a crop even though it makes some sense. Crops were an important substance that spread during the foundation era as new exotic plants and animals were being introduced from one place to the next. This allowed for greater numbers of people and civilizations to take part in the wealth of trade.

20. Religions were sources of conflict in the Sasanid Empire because their official religion was Zoroastrianism. And Zoroastrianism along with Christianity practiced intolerance of other religions. This lead to conflicts between Zoroastrian priests and believers of other religion not connected with Zoroastrianism.

21. The Silk Road affected the Sasanids because it brought people of varying faiths into their area. This was an issue because of the characteristic of Zoroastrianism discussed above. These other faiths would present themselves, and the Zoroastrian leaders would repel and persecute them.

22. The Silk road allowed for the transmission of ideas between people in the same way that the Internet of today allows for the transmission of information today among different people of many separate locations.

23. The Nestorian missionaries would believe that the people of their faith were not themselves divine but only communicators. A Manichaean missionary on the other hand would believe that you shouldn't concern yourself with specific individuals but instead focus on the forces of good and evil, in any form that they take.

24. The stirrup was important because it allowed for the knights that we know of today. It allowed for riders to wield weapons with general ease and to stay on their mount while doing so, even in the midst of combat. It further increased the value of horses as beasts of war.

25. No that is not true. The Sahel is generally the coast while the savanna is farther inland but still close enough that it has the moisture required to grow large amounts of trees and occupy a forest.

26. Both Armenia and Ethiopia were in power struggles because they had many missionaries that were looking for the ways in order to institute their specific religion. For example in Ethiopia, Roman officials commonly sent Christian missionaries in order to convert people of those areas so that the Roman officials could more easily extend their control.

27. He meant that it was interesting how similar the qualities of the individual African groups were. Even though they were separated they had many of the same practices. It appears to be a coincidence and the term Africanity is used as a way to represent these common qualities of different African peoples.

28. The Berbers were from Northern Africa and the Mbutis were from the equatorial rain forests and carried out trading and production of foods and hunting and gathering systems.
