##Questions for this document can not be provided. Please use the information described.

Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents.

1. The Vedas are essential for gaining a better understanding of the Indian areas because they acted as a collection of stories pertaining to cultures. The Vedas act a half opinionated view of India from their own perspective.

2. Indo-European populations that moved into and diffused information through India, spread a diverse set of cultures around the Indian region. These new people had different ideas about life and beiefs and by taking advantage of the trade routes around and insideof India they were able to better communicate their concepts.

3. Indian society is heavely based on skin color when it comes to caste systems. THe color of ones skin became synonomous with the class they were relatedd to. The literal color of the skin was not as important as the color of society the person was related to.

4. The classes of the Varna system included these four distinct groups: the Brahmins who included priests and scholars, the Kshatriya who included warrior and officials, Vaishya who made up the land owners, and the Shudra who were the source of labor. Eventually a fifth class of society was given the term "untouchables" as they were disregarded by the rest of society due to the demeaning jobs they performed.

5. The Aryans believed in the idea of karma which was a belief system that justified people's positions in life. The priveledged of society were meant to be on the top because they had done good in their previous life and had been born into the higher-class because of this. The lower-class accordingly, had to be filled with individuals who commited wrong actions in their past life and were being punished by being reborn in the lower-classes.

6. The evidence that supported the caste system was the same information I previously discussed, that they convinced people of the logic that they were located in their rightful place in society due to either the good or the bad actions they had commited in a past life to lead them to the position at which they now sit along with others who have been given the same fate.

7. The atman was the essence that followed every being around. Each being being controlled by one of these atman. The atman never dissapeared, instead they were reborn into another body after their previous one died. Karma is the good vs evil that the atman commited in its body, it determines the next body it will be reborn into. The next body could be any animal, but was commonly associated with the castes, as in being reborn into a caste.

8. The numerous jati act as example of strictly the varna system decided to follow its beliefs regarding social classes. They wanted to ensure that everyone understood their place in society. Unlike confucianism though, they attempted to back their ideas with religious evidence.

9. Sacrifice was essential in Hinduism during the Vedic Ages. Sacrifice was seen as an offering to the gods in order to win their protection against natural phenomena, or just to being good luck. They also helped to enforce the power of the priests, since priests were usually the only people who had the knowledge of the complex rituals and were required to have the ritual proceed. They were highly rewarded for demonstrating their knowledge of the riligious systems and practices.

10. The Rig Vedas were a series of books that contained a large collection of thousands of religious hyms and poems. These hyms and poem contained crucial information about the rituals and practices of Hindu religion. In this way, they are like the Bible because just like the Bible it uses the references of poem like stories in order to conduct its opinions and it contains information that could help to explain to outsider what being a Hindu really means.

11. Sanskrit acted as another way of separating Indian society as it disctintualized the population into those who were literate and those who were not. The literate people were given the ability to understand the religious texts of their respective religion, and therefore were higher on the social ladder than those who were illiterate and were unable to comprehend the texts. Education was only given to the higher classes, which increased the gap between them and lower levels.

12. Indian women were not given the same rights as men, like in most societies. Indian women were given a strict regiment of orders on how to live their lives, specifically on how to prepare themselves to be taken as a wife of a man. Women were often controlled by their families in order to find them husbands that were suitable for their status, or higher. Young girls nearly always had arranged marriages set up for them without their consent.

13. Mahayana and Theravada buddhists would likely come into disagreements because the Mahayana want to adapt Buddhism into something that more closely resembles a religion, except in this case the Buddha is revered as the divine entity. Theravadas on the hand would rather not worship the Buddha but instead respect him for discovering a path to enlightenment, and not praising him as a god like figure.

14. The achieving of moksha questioned the vedics because it stated that someone could become enlightened and move on from Earthly processes. This was impossible for the idea that the vedics were describing. In the original belief, it was thought that the atman don't leave from the cycle of rebirth, but instead go around inside of it indefinitely, switching places in society and the environment.

15. Jainism was a belief system that stressed the idea of nonviolence. Along with this belief was the absence of a belief in a god. The vedics on the other hand ecouraged the idea of believing in gods that could influence the real world. Jainists had very separate priorities and this was reflected in the way they conducted themselves around society.

16. THe Buddha's thoughts that understanding both the Four Noble Truths and the Eight-fold Path were based on the idea that if you relieved yourself of necessity that you could relieve yourself of suffering. And that after you relieved yourself of suffering, you would then be able to move onto with the path to enlightenment.

17. Initially Buddhism was based on the idea that if you relinquished control over problems and you calmed down your life, you could achieve enlightenment and could separate yourself from the issues that cause concern. People who believed in Buddhism didn't have to give up their previous religion, or their belief in a god, but as Buddhism evolved, the Buddha became a greater and greater symbol of a divine being, which wasn't the original concept.

18. According to the Buddha, nirvana is significant because it the area that you can only reach once you have completely disconnected from the real world, and have stopped your suffering. You have moved on to a place that doesn't require the need for Earthly materials.

19. Specifically, bodhisattvas were of major importance because they performed the same steps that the Buddha did. They, like the Buddha, reached enlightenment, but decided to stay on Earth in order to help others reach enlightenment, or in other words, continue to spread the idea of the belief system onto others.

20. Hinduism differed from Buddhism in many ascepts. For instance, Hinduism was a pol;ytheistic religion, meaning that there was the belief in many gods. While Buddhism, at least in its early form, didn't have the belief in any god. The Buddha was later regarded as a god in some circles, but he was't meant to act as the center of our universe, he was meant to be a teacher.

21. There are many reasons that Buddhism did not take a firm grasp in India. First of all, it was not looked upon favorly by those in India who were benefitting from the caste system in place, so they did what in their power to crush it. Secondly, it was a large change from the idea of polytheism and the sureness that gods provided. People might not have felt ready to make the transition, and so Buddhism was difficult for people to adopt.

22. Ashoka fought for tolerance of faiths, and in the same way George Washington in America fought for the freedom of the US from European powers, as well as fighting for US freedoms, such as the freedom of practicing your respective faith. George Washington did not give everyone complete freedom though, as he understood, like Ashoka, that people will make poor decisions against others if given complete freedom.

23. It would lead to what most consider an oppresive government because the text focuses on the economy. It touches on the welfare of the people, but the welfare of the state is regarded as more important. In this way, protecting people is not the state's number one concern, if people die, or live in poor conditions, as long as the economy and the state are fairing okay, their is no issue.

24. Each of these stories is an epic concerning different individuals. Like the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, these epics give of insight into the lifestyles of the environment around the main characters. Although the author puts most of the focus on the characters, we see in terms of history the settings the author describes and we use that knowledge to infer more events of the past.

25. The Mauryan empire was more successful as it held a very centralized government that could persuade the people living in the empire. Along with this they had a strong military that kept power located and belonging to the capital. Both of the empires held monopolies in their area and set up large taxes on the population in order to sustain the government. But the Mauryan made contributions in social reform, such as religious acceptance, while the Gupta instead used the extra income to support their theater state.

26. In terms of opinionated sayings. The Mauryan empire was more advance than the Gupta. Not because of technological innovations but instead because of cultural innovations. The Mauryans developed a key idea for having a peaceful society, and that is the concept of tolerance, in many forms. Here it specifically applies to religious tolerance, yet the king, Ashoka understood the need for force at times.

27. There were multiple reasons that the social status of women declined during the Gupta Empire. A large piece of the puzzle had to do with the popularization of the idea that the men of a family should be the ones to inherit financial assets. Along with this, women were supposed to relinquish their assets to their husband, and not remarry if their previous husband died.

28. I don't believe that it can be argued that Indian mathematicians were superior to the Roman people of the same practice, since both made contributions. It is true that Indian mathematicians are likely the origin of our base ten number system but that shouldn't be considered the most important contribution due to sheer abundance.

29. The Indian empires relied on a Persian like government structure which relied on the loyalty of local rulers and the allegiance to the capital. The Indian empires also suffered from many of the same issues as Rome and China such the rapid expansion of an empire that needed to bring in more wealth in order to sustain itself.

30. Southeast Asia was home to the Chinese empires and India was home to the Indian empires. They shared many characteristics, especially in culture, due to the ease of trade that merchants took advantage of between the two areas. The powers in Southeast Asia were consistently concerned with the idea that unification was the right path to try and lead the empire in. Shi Huangdi acted as an example of this when he unified China. In India they the large empires of the time decided to leave a majority of the power with smaller rulers.

31. The Arabic numerals are a testament to the freedom the Indian thinkers had at the time in their society. Ahsoka of the Mauryan empire demonstrated and taught religious tolerance. This helped to make people feel more comfortable in there culture and therefore were more likely to generate more interesting ideas that could benefit others in the long run.

32. The "theater-state" of the Mauryan empire really contrasts Shi Huangdi's legalist empire. This is because the theater state encouraged the rapid development of culture and promoted the growth of new ideas. These were used in order to impress other nations with the power of the state. In the Qin Empire on the other hand, the legalist form of government actively suppressed new ideas with the promotion of using the same proven legalist ideals. This reduced the cultural development of China at that time.

33. Mahayana Buddhists are like the early Christians because they encouraged people to provide donations to their monasteries in order to put the contributors in a better light. In the same way, early Christianity accepted donations from the public with the gift of pardons for sins. This was frowned upon by the lower class of Christianity. And in China, thousands of Buddhist monasteries were destroyed after the public became critical of the power the monasteries held.

34. It's accurate to state that the Malay people became the most common people of Southeast Asia because they inhabited the very fertile areas of the land and didn't have much competition to compete with. They weren't centralized but the wasn't a problem since their was no threat that needed them to band together under one state. THey took advantage of the land they lived in and made a stay in the area until later in history.

35. Funan acted as its own capital. THis was because Funan was located at a major position along a trade route between India and Southeast asia. THis provided it with a large income through imports and exports. Funan was able to tax its citizens heavily and implement its own highly centralized government that controlled its small borders. Overall it was a key city that benefitted from the tradebetween India and China, and acted as a harbor for new ideas to be diffused across the borders. 

36. Confucianism had the largest impact on its society. Chinese government has been influenced if not centered around Confucian beliefs for centuries. Confucianism is a belief system that describes how people should situate themselves in relation to all other people. It stresses the idea that everyone has their place in life, in terms of rank, between one and another, with the exception being the emperor. This prevented people from readily believing that they could move up in life, and therefore social mobility was constricted. Later in Chinese history, Confucianism became so iconic that in order to become a Chinese official, people were required to score highly on standard tests based on Confucian texts. With its idealogy of attempting to be the best you can be, for the state, Confucianism has stood the test of time, as it has been adopted by countless political orders over China's lifetime.
