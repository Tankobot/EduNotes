##Questions for this document can not be provided. Please use the information described. 

Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents. 

1. Having a main transportation road acted as an information highway, allowing for the size of the Persian empire to grow and still allow the administration to maintain control. 

2. Darius believed that his kingdom and the area it encompasses was gifted to him by the Persian god. He also thinks that he has the "grace" of Ahuramazda. 

3. Darius thought the their god was directly helping him and that the god is reason why Darius has advanced to his current position. The god gifted control over 29 countries. 

4. According to the traits listed, Alexander the Great would probably be considered a quality ruler. The biggest issue is that Alexander was not Zoroastrian, so he probably would not recieve the grace of Ahuramazda. This would prevent him from being successful, as he would not be protected from harm and the destruction of his decisions. 

5. I believe that Cyrus was the most like George Washington because he allowed the separate states of his land to have individual rights as well as abiding under his rule. 

6. When the Persians conquered people they would force them to conform to Zoroastrianism while the Assyrian empire would disperse their conquered peoples to weaken them. 

7. Satrap allowed the Empire to maintain a large area as long as the king kept the satraps loyal to his courses of action. Otherwise the entire system could fall apart as satraps take direct control if their occupied areas. 

8. I believed that Cyrus was a law giver because he had to dish new rules in order to keep his satraps in order. These rules were meant to limit the satraps power but also make Cyrus appear favorable than to split away from the empire. 

9. His entourage made it appear that he was a well recieved person even if he wasn't. The collection of people consistently around him seems to act as a propaganda. 

10. The Persepolis was a propaganda scheme acted towards foreign affairs. It was meant todos the power and control of the king over his empire. It had many artistic renderings of people giving gifts to the king, and was meant to inspire others to do so as well. 

11. It is thought to be one of the first monotheistic religions. Another monotheistic religion that came before it was Amonism from the Egyptians. The point is that Zoroastrianism was the first well recieved monotheistic religion. 

12. The Mesopotamians influenced the Persian empire by contributing information about irrigation, which was essential for the Persians as the valley they lived in had very little water. The Mesopotamians also contributed the idea of city-states, as the Persians developed city-state-like territories. 

13. Geography was a large part of Greek development because the isolation caused by mountainous terrain encouraged separate development of cultures. The other thing the mountainous terrain did was make land travel inefficient, therefore encouraging the Greeks to build great boats in order to fill their transportation needs.

14. Although we would like to believe that democracy was the government that should have been in early polis, I would make an educated guess that oligarchies were more common. The snowball effect of power would drive many states to small groups of individuals who control a majority of the power. This is important because it lead to the state of Sparta, but also lead to a place such as Athens being headed by a call to democracy. 

15. The Greek dark ages were a time period of a loss of culture as Greece lost some power. The archaic period is looked upon much fonder because it saw the emergence of greater poetry, theater, and the arts. This included subjects such as math and philosophy. 

16. It is thought that it might have been derived from the Phoenicians alphabet since they developed one of the first alphabetic written languages, with characters representing sounds. 

17. The middle class fit in different places depending on the society you lived in. Generally the middle class was below the administration but above the slaves and were ab to live a decent life. In Athens however, the middle class also had the advantage of being able to vote on topics concerning the state. 

18. Greek tyrants inspired democracy because their unjust rule gave people greater reason to overthrow them and institute a new system of government. Greek democracy was overall very helpful for the Greeks, despite them not allowing everyone of the state to vote on subjects, such as women and slaves. 

19. It helped to understand the dependence the Greeks had on their gods. Or more importantly, the role the gods played when writers and poets created literature. 

20. The role of sacrifice in Greek religion was different from most sacrificial cultures. Sacrifices were a community effort and according to the textbook, human sacrifices were not common. Instead sacrifices of other animals were commited at altars in the hopes to bring good luck to the people. 

21. The Persian war influenced Herodotus by convincing him that he should write and record history in order to better understand why events occurred and how they could be prevented later. 

22. Socratic thinkers thought about information in a new way. They understood that they didn't have all the answers yet they believed that through intuition the answers to all problems could be discovered. 

23. The writing of literature describe how Greeks were able to surpass the inability to tell exact time. The Greeks could use symbols such as the weather to understand when to harvest and maintain crops. This story demonstrates the Greek method of commiting information to writing and the intuition that the society as a whole possessed. 

24. The helots allowed for spartan population to focus on preparing for war. The helots took care of most of the Spartans labor supply. With the increased time towards preparation, they were able to build an army capable of conquering the Athenians, later in the peloponnesian war. 

25. One of the key differences between Sparta and Athens was that Athens was a usually democracy, while Sparta was a dictatorship, bordering on oligarchy. Because of this, the Athenians thought that they were a better suited society to control the Delian League. The league collected money from its members and gave it to Athens. The Spartans were done with Athens continually drawing money from league for personal societal improvements. 

26. I don't believe Pericles should be known as Pericles the Great because when compared to Alexander, he doesn't score exceptional. Alexander the Great conquered multitudes of land for the Greeks and pushed the Persians away. Pericles known for his work during the golden age of Greece such as an orator. Although this was impressive it doesn't exceed Alexander's accomplishments. 

27. The Persians conquered a section of northern Greece and the people living there inspired rebellion against their new leaders. The Greeks supported the destruction of a small amount of Persian land, and the Persians responded with Darius starting the Persian war in which he wanted to conquer all of Greece. 

28. Both the triremes and hoplites were optimized for warfare. The hoplites were heavily armed and could be dispatched quickly and the triremes were boats that were quick and efficient at moving around the Mediterranean. 

29. Athenian democracy was a direct democracy. This meant that each person of the state was able to cast a single vote, and that everyone voted on all the subject matters. Compared to a representative democracy in which the people elect representatives who cast votes in their name. In Alexandria the population was controlled by a great beuracracy that was lead by a dynasty, the well known one being the Ptolemys. 

30. Socrates was indeed an important sophist mostly because of his cleverness and the demonstration he made concerning philosophy. When he was accused of corrupting the youth of Greece he remarked about how people didn't like to put trust in new ideas and that the jealousy of a few was the reason why he was being prosecuted. People thought that he undermining religious teachings when he believed he was opening people's mind to a new method of thinking. 

31. Socrates encouraged the youth of Athens to converse and discuss new ideas. More importantly, that they should more open to ideas they are not yet accustomed to. The is ironic because a small amount of individuals who didn't believe in Socrates' way, rejected his ideas, and sentenced him to death in order to try and silence his new thoughts. 

32. I thought that Plato was a more important philosopher because he was trained under the wing of Socrates and grew up to teach one of the most influential rulers in the history of Greece, Alexander the Great. Aristotle on the other hand did offer perplexing ideas such as the Allegory of the Cave, but in terms of worldly significance the honor goes to Plato for his impact. 

33. Women as rulers in Persia actually were very politically influential and made prominent public appearences. Greek women alternatively were given very little rights including one of the most important rights of our time. The right to vote on political decisions and to have political representation. An exception to very low rights were the women of Sparta who, although not having as many rights as men, were very respected for their work in raising the military class. 

34. Sparta's victory lead to the downfall of democracy as Athens was democracy's homeland. The war lead to turmoil of many Greek states as they fought amongst themselves. 

35. The Greeks were never going to be satisfied with being ruled over by others. The helots aren't happy being ruled by the Spartans, the Spartans weren't happy paying tribute to Athens, and Greece was not happy protecting land from the Persians. Although they sometimes find temporary solutions, this issue continues to rise up again and again. 

36. The world was commonly dynastic. This means that rulers would expect the next in their blood line or heritage to take the reins of command after they died or passed away. The hellenistic spread brought forth the idea of representation. People wanted their leaders to represent their interests. The Mandate of Heaven slightly encouraged this idea by justifying an the overthrow of an unjust emperor. 

37. The epoch that Alexander the Great brought about was the introduction of Greek ideas into other areas of the world. This was caused by the far outreach of influence the Greeks created when their empire expanded. The Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and Antigonid empires were the result of Alexander the Great not passing on his thrown to a specific person or council, therefore generals fought for the position as ruler and broke the Greek empire up into three kingdoms under their respective names. 

38. First of all the Ptolemies ruled in an Alexandria, named after the ruler. Like Alexander they expanded their rule and when they conquered new people they replaced the government, collected the wealth that the previous government had, and kept the current population performing in the same way they were used to. 

39. In terms of culture I believe that Athens was more impressive as it was one of the seeds for hellenistic ideas while the library at Alexandria acts as a growth stimulant. The library provided a modern area for new philosophers of this later age to explore previously inexcessable studies. Athens allowed for the encouragement of new ideas with its form of democracy. Like most societies, they had their limits on new profound ideas and in the case of Aristotle, would enforce these limits.
