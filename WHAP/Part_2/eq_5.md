##Questions for this document can not be provided. Please use the information described. 

Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents. 

1. The essential economic activity of the Romans was the usage of standard coinage. It was hugely influential as it allowed for a greater transmission of goods between persons, and gave the wealthy a standard method of determining worth. Another critical economic activity was the governments control of food resources in order to make sure that their population almost always had enough food to eat. 

2. Roman became anti-dictators after they experienced issues with emperors gaining too much much power, and refusing to relinquish control back to the senate. For example, Caesar became the emperor after acting as a general, but he eventually was on the list for becoming dictator for life, which the senate quickly put a stop to. 

3. Tribunes encouraged a better democracy because they gave support to the lower class of Rome, who wouldn't have been able to get a say in politics otherwise. The tribunes were representatives of the Plebeians and are critical in the political history of Rome. 

4. The Roman Senate was supposed to vote on every decision that was made. They acted as representatives for the empire and made choices in that manner. The Roman Senate did happen to make mistakes every so often though. The bigger issue, was singular rulers of Rome attempting to pull off power grabs, and steal authority away from the Senate. 

5. The Conflict of Orders highlighted one of the key issues in the Roman Republic, which was that the republic was mostly run by the wealthy, specifically the particians. The Plebeians, or the lower class, was misrepresented and therefore the Conflict of Orders developed, and eventually the plebeians created their own set of representatives who could veto patrician decisions. 

6. The paterfamilias consisted of the oldest male, who was the dominant of the family, the wife, who tended to obey the husband, and the children, who had to respect their parents. The patron client relationship is represented here because the children owe the parents for raising them, and therefore deserve respect. 

7. I would much rather be a patrician as they held more power than the plebeians, even if they could eventually be vetoed by the plebeians. They were still the main source for laws, and most upheld a high standard of living, while plebeians performed tasks such as farming. 

8. In Greece women had very little to no representation, as they were unable to vote on political decisions. In Rome women were also not allowed to vote, yet some women of high status had the ability to influence their husbands into making decisions in their interest. Neither situation would be accepted today but Rome was the lesser of two evils. 

9. They attempted to institute all powerful emperors who had complete control, but were expected to act justly. Although this didn't work in the end, it was a fairly accepted plan as a series of influential emperors gained power and kept Rome on the right track towards glory of their state, and peace within the Empire. 

10. The Greeks were very resistant to allow outsiders into their cultures due to the Greeks being so isolated from the rest of the world. This was likely caused by their interesting geography. The Romans on the other learned to conquer peoples but to try and make the new people confortable, so as to prevent revolts from occuring. The logic being that satisfied enemies won't fight. 

11. The Romans used approximately the same method of ruling provinces that the Persians did. They governed far away lands by building efficient state roads that could carry messages quickly to and from the capital. The Persians uniquely put minor rulers to act as the government in the areas, and these minor rulers took orders from the king. In Rome, the emperor attempted to directly control most of the provinces. 

12. Their are too many insignificant reasons to count, but the main idea was that people were happy with a dictator. Julius Caeser won a number of battles, took control away from the senate, rid the government of the tribunes, and overall increased Rome's economic standing. People experienced a higher standard of living, and so were more accepting of the rule of the emperor, not wishing to return to a senate. 

13. Rome was heavily dependent upon slavery and used it as their major work force. They used them usually for farming in order to maintain the Roman standard of living, providing large quantities of food to the higher class. In China however, slavery was much less common, and therefore the normal population had to occupy the farming work force. China wasn't able to experience as many of the luxeries, but it encouraged the Chinese to discover new technologies that would make the job of farming easier and more efficient. 

14. Augustus wanted to maintain his high status, and didn't want the other members of the government to feel that he was sharing power. Instead he made it appear as if he was sharing power, but instead only looked towards the rest of his council as an organization of advisors. 

15. The Twelve Table of Rome was an event in which laws for Rome were agreed upon, and it was decided that everyone was expected to follow these rules. In the same way, Hammurabi's code was made for the purpose of providing the public with a set of rules that they could trust, instead of rules being decided during specific instances. 

16. The Hellenistic age was the spread of Greek ideas to surrounding areas because of the Greek's expansion. Like the Pax Romana, the golden age of Rome, the Hellenistic age also allowed for greater scientific and cultural inquiry, since knowledgable resources were spread more widely, and more easily accessible for scholars. 

17. The upper class Romans maintained a very high standard of living and initially made most of the decisions concerning the government on behalf of the lower class. The lower class in turn generally occupied the more labor intensive jobs of Rome, such as farming and the building of public structures. 

18. Romanization took the areas that Rome conquered and introduced them to Roman ideas and beliefs. Alowing for Roman culture to be diffused quicker and throughout larger expanses of southern Europe. 

19. Jesus was one of the original spreaders of Christianity, which believed that Jesus was the son of God. Paul also acted as a communicator to bring the word of Christianity to a larger number of people. Christianity stressed the idea that the lower people of society would be on the top, while the top would move down to the bottom. Roman officials and the upper class were not accepting of these ideals yet an emperor of Rome eventually adopted Christianity anyways. 

20. Monotheists were heavily persecuted in Rome, especially including Christians who were known for practicing their faith in hiding. This was before Rome became a Christian empire. This was when the Edict of Milan was instituted, providing protection for Christians. It stated that the Roman state would practice religious tolerance of Christianity. 

21. Roman Christians wanted to still be able to celebrate Christian events in Rome, but for Rome. Saint Valentine was one of the first Roman saints and acts as a symbol of Roman adoption of Christianity, as Valentine's day is representative of a Roman saint, connecting Rome and Christianity. 

22. Aqueducts were critical to Roman empire in the same way that they were critical for the Greeks. The Aqueducts were another way of improving the Roman standard of living and helping to keep certain high population cities clean. They acted as images of Roman advancement, and the high status of Romans in general when compared with people of other civilizatons. Diocletian and Constantine both encouraged development of projects and technologies like the aqueducts to improve the Roman image and their support. 

23. The council decided on important Christian decisions as a whole, and was occupied by an organized group of bishops. They agreed upon the nature of Jesus and allowed for Christianity to maintain a very uniform state, attempting to prevent the evolution of Christianity, but instead keep people believing the systems. 

24. Christians would consider Shi Huangdi a pagan most likely because he didn't believe in Christianity. As well as not believing in specific gods anyways. Instead he believed in Legalism which was a method of belief in which the laws had total control, that spread even more extensively than the emperor's power. 

25. It would be inaccurate to state that Latin remained the dominant language of Europe as we have today in the modern age that Latin is but view in rear window. Latin is no longer well spread but instead only used by a very small minority, proving that it has not held up against the test of time. 

26. Agriculture was imperitave because the growing of rice allowed for a larger quantity of the population to occupy themselves with jobs other than farming. Instead they could focus on specialization, such as smithing, art, and literature. 

27. The Roman Empire allowed for people to make many decisions by themselves, while still instituting strict rules that people needed to abide by. In China however, the government used of strong fist to govern its people, and maintained strict instruction on how their population should act. Confucianism was influential in this thought as it told everyone to be the best they could be for the betterment of their state. 

28. The warring states period was a stage in Chinese history in which many different macrogovernments were continually fighting for control over one another, and no one could gain the upper hand. Eventually the Qin reunited China and gained a grip on the political structure of the land. 

29. Evidence to prove this argument comes in the form of the women of the families in China. They provided for the families, while the men were expected to support the family. Women of China were the main producers of manufactured cloths. Family was usually controlled by Confucianism which gave everyone in society a position relative to another. 

30. Confucianism convinced many people of China that their position in the Empire was acceptable as they were relative to everyone else. Confucianism gave simple solutions for who was alpha to who else. It allowed for a social structure which let people control others and others control others, and so on and so forth, providing rock solid foundations for command. 

31. Qin Huangdi was an efficient leader because he instituted new regulations into the empire and set up standards. This allowed the Qin Empire to succeed extremely quickly with their economy as standards allowed for an ease of transmuission of materials, designs and pieces to manufactured goods. Critically including the standardization of roads, allowing for easier travel. 

32. A prime minister was necessary because the emperor had to many big idea problem that he was concerned with in order to handle proceed with day to day topics. He had to assign other officials to handle details while he concerned himself with wide range decisions. This can be connected to the Persian which instituted a system of lower officials to govern land under the king. 

33. Both the Gentry and aristocrats, and the latifundia all shared the characteristic of being wealthy. This wealth came with power. Specifically the power to make larger political decisions, according to their power. The decisions they made often benefitted themselves, and helped to rise them even higher of the polical food chain. 

34. Confucianism had an immense impact on the Chinese government and was one of the most practiced belief system in ancient China. It was the foundation of polical structures in China and helped to give purpose to peoples status, not only in the government, but also on a domestic level. Daoism was arguably less influential, it emerged during the warring states period in response to the conflict and stressed the idea of going with the flow of life. 

35. Silk was one of the key exports of Chinese industry. It was traded mostly along the silk road. It's a staple of chinese manufacturing and is remembered today for how rare and valuable it was. Only the Chinese knew how to grow and harvest silk worms and because of this, and the great wealth that the silk production brought, the methods of retrieving and refining the silk were closely guarded secrets. 

36. The tributary system was a collection of trade networks between China and other civilization for mutually beneficial relations. The Han Dynasty likely fell due to them spreading to thin. They occupied large amounts of territory, attempted to trade with a variety of civilizations, and desperately scrambled to secure their ever increasing borders. Eventually they fell, and without enough economy to support them, they succombed to an onslaught of invaders that push through their weak defenses. 

37. Both the Romans and the Han Dynasty bit off more than they could chew in terms of power. They expanded their borders, again and again. They were unable to pull in the revenue neccessary to satisfy their ever increasing military demands, but they chose to continue expansion. When resistance started up at their borders, they were unable to protect themselves because of their cripled position. They lost power and were eventually overthrown because of these losses.
