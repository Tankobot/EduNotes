#India and Southeast Asia, 1500 B.C.E. - 600 C.E. 

##Foundations of Indian Civilization, 1500 B.C.E. - 300 C.E. 

India has three topgraphical regions and encounters storms known as monsoons and also has enough moisture to grow lare amounts of crops without irrigation. The Vedic Age was named after the text, the Vedas, and it marked a period of Indian history with great technological advancement. The varna is a caste system and it was critical in Indian history as it separated the different classes of India and went along in their belief that depending on your karma, you could be born as an animal, or as a human of a different class. Obviously there were people and groups of people who did not agree with this class structure and the strength of the upper-class, Buddhism was one of the results of these deviants, and Buddhism, like other religions, was modified over time in order to resemble something closer to the religions we know today. The two popular religions include Buddhism and Hinduism, which takes advantage of common to find happiness in the reassurances that there are higher forces controlling the world and maintaining balance on their part, not requiring them to take direct responsibility for actions. 

##Imperial Expansion and Collapse, 324 B.C.E. - 650 C.E. 

The Mauryan Empire was India's first centralized empire and it instituted unprescendented control over India by providing features of urban life and optimizing the income of the government, a king named Ashoka was also very important as he converted to Buddhism and practiced the idea of the government practicing religious tolerance on their people while still maintaining order over transgressors. After the collapse of the Mauryan Empire political fragmentation followed, although this period also lead to technological advancements and the development of more standardized writing and the emergence of greater works of art. The Gupta Empire was considered to not be as centralized as its predecessors but did demonstrate the ability to attract local administrations of neighboring societies, they also lowered the status of women and reinstuted the Hinduism and the caste system which separated the classes. 

##Southeast Asia, 50 - 600 C.E. 

Southeast Asia has dependable rainfall and due to this has dependable amounts of food production. Malay peoples improve their technology and are able to advance in areas such as metallurgy due to the excess of food. Southeast Asia also traded with the Hindus and Buddhists of India generating large amounts of income for both societies. Specifically, a society by the name of Funan controlled a key point in the trade route between the two landmasses and grew in wealth collecting import and export taxes. 

##Environment + Technology 

Indian mathematics is considered to be the first use of a base ten system which was a leap in terms of math. Indians were able to use this new system in order to map out their belief in large expanses of time. They also invented the digit zero to represent nothing, or the absense of a number. Finally this method of numerical solving was spread around the world and is used in a modified form today. 

##Diversity and Dominance 

In this section we are told about the Kama Sutra an Indian text that describes the conduct of men and women. It describes how men should look for women who are evenly proportioned and have many factors that would help to maintain or improve the man's standing in society. Later discussing the relation between a wife and a husband giving much greater privilege to the husband. 

##Conclusion 

Belief systems have been a key part of all societies and remained a key part of the Indian soceity. Whether it was a caste system or what they thought necessary to record down in writing, it was influenced by their beliefs. Although India experienced many periods of division, they brought about economic and intellectual successes. 

#Reflection 

words = {
	mathematics = Mathematics is a key defining characteristic of this chapter because India developed the first base ten math system which allowed for great numbers to be modified with general ease. This allowed people to keep track of numbers never before possible, a major contribution to modern technology. 
	tolerance = Surprisingly, many of the civilizations discussed above had a fair amount of religious tolerance for their time. An example of this would be the Mauryan empire which permitted for the practice of religions not the same as the government's standard, although still maintaining power. 
	caste = Although almost self explanatory, caste was a large piece of Indian culture and still exists today. For exmaple, while the varna was in use, Indian people abiding to its code practiced strict class distinctions between groups. This lead to some humans being worth more than others, but was balanced by the idea that karma decided the class you would live in, and if you were good, you could advance in the next life.
