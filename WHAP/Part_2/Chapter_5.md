#An Age of Empires: Rome and Han China, 753 B.C.E. - 600 C.E. 

##Rome's Mediterranian Empire, 753 B.C.E. - 600 C.E. 

The Romans had a belief system very similar to the Greeks and allowed their women better rights than what they would have had in Greece, and Rome was controlled by a system of elites and lower classes with voting power. Rome expanded into many different neighboring regions under the leadership of people like Julius Caesar, but control of the civilization switched hands numerous times as generals took the city and exercised dictatorships. During the Roman Principate, emperors suggested new laws for the senate to affirm, and Christianity took root in Rome but was condemned for a long period. Romans took advantage of technology such as arches and aquaducts in order to maintain a high standard of living but the empire suffered great losses and was in consistent turmoil until emperors such as Diecletian and Constantine took control and reunited the empire while instituting new laws. Byzantine empire consisted of the eastern half of the Roman empire and they had conflict with the Germanic people but eventually settled the disputes by marching soldiers there and back in record time to demonstrate their power. 

##The Origins of Imperial China, 221 B.C.E. - 220 C.E. 

The Han Chinese made sure to gather food in order to provide food at reasonable prices throughout the year, and they adopted Confucianism which made them a patriarchal society and greatly lowered the power of women in society. The Qin, before the han, adopted Legalism instead and strict laws were enforced upon the people of the civilization, but helped by making the standardization of things an important attribute of their society. The Han set up class distinctions but stressed the idea that people could move between classes, and Daoism was another belief system conceived that was based on acceptance of the way of life. The Chinese of this time period were much farther ahead than any other civilization in terms of technology, having developed steel, water powered mills, and the transportation of silk by various methods to generate wealth. Finally, the conflicts on the fronts of the civilization were too much for the administration to handle along with decentralized rulers who didn't readily accept Han supremacy, leading to the downfall of the long standing Han Chinese civilization. 

##Imperial Parallels 

Both Rome and China used a system of patriarchy, lowering the status of women. They spread their own ideas to surrounding regions in order to increase total support of their government. They standardized cities so as to provide the same systems in different areas of their empires. And, they eventually fell due to choas internally, and the attempt to maintain border that were too large and thin to sustain efficiently. 

##Environment + Technology 

The delivery of water to key areas of a civilization is essential. Therefore, the Romans developed aquaducts that carried water vast distances and the Chinese used slightly less advanced systems of complex canals in order to draw water from their large number of rivers. Both of these creations helped to support each society's way of life. 

##Diversity and Dominance 

Slavery was fairly common in Rome, which was a problem since it took jobs away from lower-class citizens. In China slavery was less common but still a practiced idea. In Rome slaves were used to their fullest extent and had barely any rights. But in China, slaves were protected by certain laws and only had to abide to what their contracts detailed. In both societies, slaves had lost a great deal of what made them human in terms of their masters and they would revolt by performing less work, and generally passively disobeying their orders. 

##Conclusion 

The Roman Empire and the Chinese empires expanded much faster than what was usually common, allowing them to extend greater control. The Romans had to develop methods for ruling and this took time, although it was almost designed, the empire fell too early for that to happen. The Chinese on the other hand, already had a method of rule and like the Romans justified their rulers through divination. Both Empires had strong similarities in both their upbringing and their downfall. 

#Reflection 

Topic: Power

Description: The Romans and the Han both controlled through power. Most civilizations rule in this way, as opposed to ruling through mutual respect. The problem is that many people will take advantage of mutual respect systems and force them to collapse and dilate into the very system they were attempting to avoid. The Romans demonstrated great power when they were under the leadership of generals who took singular power to put in place their own policies and ideas. The Chinese demonstrated great power when they used a hybrid of Legalism and Confucianism in order to both please the people and keep control over their actions in order to prevent the creation of entropy in their kingdom.
