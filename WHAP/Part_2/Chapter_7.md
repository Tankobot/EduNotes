#Networks of Communication and Exchange, 300 B.C.E. - 600 C.E. 

##The Silk Road 

The Silk Road was a network of transportation that connected China to the Mediterranean. Parthians controlled a portion of the Silk Road. The Silk Road gained popularity because the Chinese wished to have resources such as horses from the west and the Mediterranean civilizations wished to have the Chinese exclusively-grown-in-the-area silk. 

##The Sasanid Empire, 224 - 600 

The Sasanid Empire made use of the Silk Road and also adopted the Zoroastrian religion. They eventually swapped this religion for strict Christian views and found theological ideas contrary to their beliefs un-christian enough to persecute the creators of such theories. The Silk Road impacted the Sasanid Empire by contributing new inventions to the mix, for example, the stirrup was invented to allow for better horseback combat and Buddhism was able to go up against the religions of Christianity and Zoroastrianism. 

##The Indian Ocean Maritime System 

The Indian Ocean was the location of great travel between Africa, India, and China, and demonstrated the advancements that India had in ship building for seafaring vessels. People from Southeast Asia migrated to the Island of Madagascar and greater relations developed with the African people on the mainland, and many crops were introduced from Southeast Asia. Indian Ocean trade routes were the able to trade highly valued products such as ivory but didn't carry the same volume that the Mediterranean was able to, and the expansive trade between different peoples cause the seaside areas to be culturally diverse. 

##Routes Across the Sahara 

Routes were created in order to cross the Sahara after it experienced a long era of dryness. At first, only nomadic peoples were able to cross the Saharan, but with the introduction of camels, people were able to cross larger expanses of the desert with a fair amount of ease. Resources such as salt were traded across the desert and people adopted a close version of the Roman lifestyle, but eventually turned to nomadism as the Roman Empire fell. 

##Sub-Saharan Africa 

Sub-Saharan Africa had a large expansive list of different environments that it occupied, including semiarid steppes, to tropical savanna, to tropical rain forest, to more savanna, to greater steppe and desert, finally ending with highlands at the southernmost end. This region developed a level of grand traditions that spread across the area, while smaller local traditions maintained uniquity, until later in time that Europeans would impose their uniform beliefs. Africans developed a unique system of music have spread their cultural unity farther than the local area, but they became less popular as increased dryness of the land constricted population. The adoption of iron smelting was a big event for the region and historians still argue how it was either introduced or discovered, but they do believe that it's knowledge was spread through the use of a Bantu language. 

##The Spread of Ideas 

The section begins by describing how historians are continually arguing about the origins of different ideas, in its example they use pigs and the origination of coinage. Buddhism was a popular religion that was spread by way of the Silk Road as well as other methods and stressed for practicing followers to attain nirvana but stay on Earth in order to help others make the journey, these teachings were spread to Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and Japan. The spread of Christianity competed with Zoroastrianism and was mostly seeded from Constantinople, which converted people from Yemen and Ethiopia, which became large centers of the Christian religion. 

##Environment + Technology: Camel Saddles 

The first camel saddles were very militarily inefficient as they required the rider to have to occupy his hands with controlling the camel. The later saddle allowed rider to fight will riding by controlling the camel with their feet. The North Arabian saddle allowed for the easy attachment of weight to the camel, allowing people to use camels with greater efficiency for the transportation of materials, increasing land trade across deserts. 

##Diversity and Dominance: The Indian Ocean Trading World 

We read a piece of literature written by merchant who is travelling the Indian Ocean. Trading economy was a key piece of all the societies that this merchant encountered on the coast and somewhat inland. Most of the societies are culturally diverse. Most of them have some form of their own structured government and are carriers of many resources such as metals, crops, and cloth. 

##Conclusion 

Trade in this chapter was facilitated by the Silk Road, Indian Ocean, and trans-Saharan exchanges. The Bantu leads us to believe that it was the cause of the spread of advanced metallurgy. And the spread of Christianity and Buddhism expanded far across multiple continents, by taking advantage of the trade routes of means of cultural expansion. 

#Reflection 

words {
	trade: Trade was a major part of this chapter because the primary focus of the chapter was how trade routes developed and contributed to different civilizations. Examples from this chapter include the Silk Road, Saharan trade routes, and the Indian Ocean, all acting as methods of moving goods around the world. 
	culture: Along with goods, these trade routes allowed for the spread of ideas like nothing else the world had seen. Cultures and ethnicities were able to move around the world, and unique beliefs developed in different lands separated by large lands. The ideas were still able to spread because of the transportation though, as merchants carried with them their own cultures. 
	expansive: Ideas, cultures, and materials all were able to reach new heights of expansion. This was expressed especially with religion, as beliefs such as Christianity and Buddhism were able to cross continents from their original homelands of Rome (primary seed) and India.
