#The Rise of Islam, 600 - 1200 C.E. 

##The Origins of Islam 

The Origins of Islam began in Mecca, a city that grew in popularity and contained a building name the Ka'ba which had many idols in it. Mohammad lived in Mecca when he had revelations that he believed were given to him by the Angel Gabriel who was speaking the words of God, and told Muhammad that people will be judged at the end of their life and that Muhammad was the last prophet, and that much of the Bible was true. Muhammad lived in Medina for a long while continuing to provide revelations on how Muslims should live their life until his death, when his closest follower, Abu Bakr, took control and organized the construction of a single collection of all of Muhammads revelations. Divisions of Islam broke out as Sunnis believed that the leader of Islam should be nominated and chosen by the community, while Shi'ites believed that the leader of Islam has to be a descendant of Muhammad. 

##The Rise and Fall of the Caliphate, 632 - 1258 

The Islamic people expanded massively in their area to many other areas such as Syria, Egypt, Spain, India, Anatolia, and sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of Muslims stayed in the military and collected resources as taxes from their non-Muslim subjects and the Muslims did not recieve land for military work. The Umayyad caliphate eventually fell to the Abbasids who showed concern for the interpretation of the Quran and its use as a legal document, and many of the new peoples who were conquered began converting to Islam, allowing for a more cosmopolitan elite. The caliphs lost power in many areas but the strength of Islam continued to grow as more people converted and Spain was inhabited by a large number of Muslims. Baghdad lost power as public constructions became under maintained and agriculture suffered, Turks took control and the government became fixed with caliphs who really controlled by the Turks and the use of slaves who were converted to Islam. 

##Islamic Civilization 

Muslims believed that everyone should act in the same way as the Prophet Muhammad, with a problem being that the people who knew him well were passing away and it became increasingly more difficult to track down accurate records of him, therefore the different sects compiled a collection of the reports to accept. People in these areas who were not already Muslim would consider converting to Islam in order to reap the benefits of lower taxes and increased growth by moving to Islamic urban centers. Although Muslim women had greater rights in comparison with much of the world, they were still considered to be untrusted. As caliphs appeared in separate areas the need for recentralization was seen, and when new places were conquered scholars were recieved well and the pilgramige to Mecca united most of Islam and made Mecca the center. 

##Diversity and Dominance: Beggars, Con Men, and Singing-Girls 

Beggars and street performers belonged to small commuinities of people which organized their own tricks and exploits. Singing-girls were trained by men of high class in order to act as a person who is consistently with the man. The section uses a writing from a man who was ugly and explains the pros of having a singing-girl. We see that texts of this era were commonly written from everyday life through anecdotes. 

##Environment + Technology: Automata 

Muslim scientists translated many works of other languages into Arabic and put them in large libraries. They made advancements in technology by taking advantage of the information of these other cultures. The topic of this section though is automata which were machines designed by Muslims to complete tasks mechanically and impress visitors. 

##Conclusion 

Muslims united under the community of umma. They were usually ethincally diverse and religiously diverse when living with other peoples. Eventually Muslims developed systems of smaller religious institutions such as brotherhoods, which for Islam to be carried into new areas of the world, protected by small political rulers. 

#Reflection 

words {
	
	community: Islam was founded on comunities of people. They allowed for outsiders to easily join their faith and were accepting of faiths such as Christianity and Judaism. 
	
	diversity: Because of how accepting Muslims were at this time, the Muslim population was ethnically divers and was comprised of many different peoples. These people added to Islam's power and were supported and treated just like any other Muslim. 
	
	direction: The Muslim people eventually discrovered that having a single caliph was unrealistic. After this discovery they figured out how to continue being united through the use of brotherhoods and the common belief of the pilgramige to Mecca, which obviously soon a center for Muslim belief.
