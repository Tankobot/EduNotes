#EQs for Chapter 9

##Questions for this document can not be provided. Please use the information described.

Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents.

1. They were more powerful because they were able to survive outside pressures. This is unlike the Roman emperors who tended to crumble underneath the issues associated with spending money to protect themselves from invaders. Eventually rulers such as Constantine were able to further increase the Byzantine empire's forces until it stood as an important force in Southern Europe.

2. Because the area was indeed an empire, it had to be controlled by a single ruler. This was a problem because the state had very little influence over the decisions that being made, and they had to put a large amount of their faith into the members of power. When poor rulers showed up, the empire fell into peril without a strong unifying force.

3. The plague of Justinian is a blanket term that describes a plague that spread throughout the eastern Empire and caused a large amount of the population to grow doubt in the single power. We see this as a common issue since rulers put a lot of their power in the idea that people were to be believed that they had a divine nature, that protected their decisions from wrong doing. When errors such as this occur, people lose their faith in the ruling members.

4. The women in the Byzantine Empire received a portion of rights compared to their male counterparts. They enjoyed a small amount of freedom in public but were often confined to the household. The women of the Islamic kingdom were given even worse rights though. Compared to men, they were only allowed to go outside when given permission from their husband, and they were only able to commit actions that are allowed by their male members of their family.

5. The Byzantine Empire was being controlled by a large list of amazing leaders which helped it to overcome many of their boundaries and kept the empire stable. This could only last for so long, because outside forces, such as those coming from Northern Europe, put pressure on the Empire's finances until they were broke and could no longer support their own defenses.

6. The Eastern Orthodox church had a unique writing style properly named Cyrillic after its creator Cyril. Along with this alternative concept, the church emphasized the importance of the emperor. While the western church put the papacy in a more important position and standing.

7. The most important reason as to why the Eastern Byzantine Empire inherited so many pieces of culture from the Roman was because it grew out of the Roman empire splitting. In the same way that the Romans eventually became an empire, the Eastern empire continued this, and didn't slide back into the use of a senate.

8. Europe was dominated by strongmen because they were easy to hire and they could act a sort of militia, not comparable to the serfs that served their estate owners. They could protect the people of the land who were too poor to protect themselves. This allowed for a large amount of people to pull together and produce goods.

9. The Carolingian economic system was heavily based on merchants being encouraged while the people hired mercenaries that could help defend the area. This was a problem because the hired army was not as loyal as people who believed in the actual government and in the land.

10. Charlemagne was a hero because he supported an economic system based on land and this unified groups of people into smaller towns that could be more powerful than just individual peoples. A reason that Charlemagne could have been considered evil, is for the same consequence. The new system gave too many powers to small rulers, instead of handing over control to an administration that could make more informed decisions.

11. Vikings were greatly feared because they were considered barbarians that didn't understand civil life. This is incorrect as they did indeed have complex social structures. Another reason that they were feared was because they had amazing that could allow them to come onto the shores of Europe, attack local villages, and leave without authorities being able to stop them.

12. The Vikings are allowed to be in the historical books because people have demonstrated so many misconceptions about them that they needed to be cleared up. Another reason is that the Vikings were able to capture many of the Northern Countries of Europe before they became actual countries.

13. They are kept in the Christian monasteries because the buildings are able to act as preservation warehouses. This is made even more important because the different areas of Europe had different ideas, and preventing a single political power from being able to review all of these documents has given us greater insight into the actual situation of the region.

14. The Europeans of the early world were prosperous and grew their population at a quick rate. After approximately three hundred years, the black death broke out and it was able to wipe out a majority of the population, which could have included me. Although it was better for Europe in the long run in many ways, it would have still likely had me meet my demise.

15. The rise of manors was likely caused by the decreased cost to hire individuals before the plague. People would work and their family included underneath the leadership of an estate owner. The owner would receive a portion a hefty portion, of the workers products in exchange for some amount of protection of the people and their family.

16. Life was very tough for the workers but easy for the owners. This was because the workers received pay comparable to that of slaves. The owners maintained a strong distinction between them, and those beneath them. This was changed after the plague, when the shortage of workers made owners have to pay people higher wages.

17. Feudalism was the system by which kings governed large areas of land and handed them out as payments to their favored subjects. In return the person who now partially owned the land with the king. Or more importantly, managed the land for the king, paid its profits the rulers. This was a good system for the higher members of society, but it disconnected lower members from their wealth.

18. They were scared that if they didn't accept their new place, they wouldn't be able to defend themselves from outside threats. This was a problem and it allowed the owners of the regions to take advantage of this fear and use it to play the work and labor out of serfs for very little pay, because no one could offer the same protection.

19. They acted as members of the feudal society because they usually benefited from this system. The fiefs were the land that was awarded to members of the knights who protected the kingdom. The knights benefited by receiving this land for a fair amount of works. And the vassals were the knights after they had received the land grants.

20. Christianity was brought to the Scandinavians and the Slavs because the leaders of Christianity pushed their own religious leaders into the positions of the government and helped to contribute to the populations acceptance of the new religion. This was also helped because no strong centralized religious force held opposition.

21. The conditions for the women of Southern Europe were similar to elsewhere in the world. They might be considered to be slightly improved because they held greater rights in the household when not located in urban environments. Women who belonged to religious monasteries and acted as nuns held both more rights as they performed actions like men but they were also restricted to strict religious practices.

22. There was great conflict because they disagreed on who should be the leader of the religion. The western church believed that the pope should hold the most power while the eastern church had decided that the king of an area was also the leader of the church. This resulted in many conflicts between decisions of the kings and the popes.

23. Schisms are situations were different groups within the church disagree so much on a certain subject that it causes the church to be split into two different groups. This is a big event because if both of the sections grow into popular systems then they are likely to keep at ends with each other. This made them a threat to the Roman Catholic Church because they allowed for people to diverge from the main belief.

24. The controversy was so important because it put the power of the pope at risk by handing over the power to the landlords. This was resolved by the landlords developing their own form of the church which didn't have to answer to the pope. This s once again a larger issue because the popes are disappointed with losing all of this influence.

25. Usually leaders in power don't like to share their rule with any other people. Having the pope and the king consistently battle for power is difficult because they both want to be the higher piece. On one hand people are supposed to be loyal to the king in terms of the state. But on the other, they are told that they can only have the benefits of the religion if they follow the pope.

26. It can be argued on this point because Benedict was the founder of many of the first monasteries in Italy and he taught many different sets of people the way to lie life in seclusion rather than within a large society. But instead of living in complete seclusion he told that people should live with others who practice the faith just as rigorously.

27. Monks were able to document lots of information that didn't just concern religion specifically. They tended to be knowledgeable because they maintained large libraries that held numbers of books on a variety of subject. They also influenced politics because they  usually secluded themselves from the common politics and this was a problem as they needed to play some type of role to have an effect on their region.

28. He was exiled from his lands inside of Russia but he was able to return back to Russia and he made himself a prince. This was important because he regained power and returned as a large religious leader for Christianity. He and his advisers had decided on Christianity because it didn't place a ban on the consumption of alchoholic beverages, and it allowed for the capture of Jerusalem. 

29. He sent representatives to Constantinople and they would report back information about how amazing it was. This was communicated to both the leaders of the Orthodox Church and to Vladimir which resulted in him choosing to have the Orthodox chruch as their choice for the church. He was able to make Christianity popular in Russia and could influence other princes in the regions surrounding him. 

30. Trade was extremely important because food was very hard to grow in such northern lands. THe soils were not fertile enough to grow large amounts of foodstuffs. This made it neccesary for Russia to import food if it wanted to increase its own population and work supply. This eventually lead to the population of Russia that made it comparable with other powers of the time. 

31. THe horse collar allowed for riders to have better control of their mounts and it allowed for easier farming. The farming benefits were the most important because it allowed for horses to be used to produce even greater amounts of food. The horse were definitely more expensive then the usual oxen, but they made up for this by being able to grow and harvest crops at a faster speed. 

32. The life of the commune in Italy and the city of the Flanders were dictated by private cities. These cities were run by small groups of people who were awarded their semi independence from the king that once owned their lands. This was helpful for both the king and the people because the cities often attracted peoples from surrounding areas and allowed for a larger production of manufactured goods. 

33. The main cause for cities to wish to return to western Europe was the abundance of resources. The resources that could be found in this area of the world, specifically timber, was unheard of elsewhere. THis allowed for large numbers of human habitats to be constructed, while also contributing to the deforestation of the western European lands. This would eventually be bad for the region, but at the moment it allowed for unprescedented growth. 

34. The abundant coinage allowed for peoples of different lands to exchange common currencies. This was great because it vastly expanded the limits of trading and encouraged people to avoid bartering for specific items with other specific items. It also demonstrated that the community was rich enough that they could supply a metal coinage system. 

35. THe crusades demonstrated the impact that Christianity was making in a variety of areas. The leaders of Christianity tended to be quite power hungry and this lead to the spread of Chrisitianity in even more areas. CHristianity also left a mark on many cultures because of their religious intolerance and they way in which they punihed people who had separate ideas. 

36. The crusades were caused by the Chrisitians's want to remove the Muslim powers from areas of pilgrimage. The pilgrimage acted as a way for the Christians to infultrate Muslim lands. Eventually the Chrsitian leaders wanted control over the Holy Lands, so they began a campaign that promised a large number of religious benefits for people who fought for the religious cause of Christian leaders. The Crusades resulted in Christian and Muslim powers to be at greater odds and it pulled cultural influences in from outside areas towards the opposing forces.
