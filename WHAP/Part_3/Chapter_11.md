# Peoples and Civilizations of the Americas, 600 - 1500

## Classic-Era Culture and Society in Mesoamerica, 600 - 900

Mesopotamian society was very advanced for its time and contained complete populations that used the same methods of political classes that were common elsewhere. Teotihaucan was a major city of Mesopotamia and had large populations and creations that supported it, even though it was decentralized and had a violent downfall. The Mayan civilization was very successful, despite their lack of complex technology such as wheels, they were able to develop intricate religious beliefs and one of their most well known creations, the Mayan calendar.

## The Postclassic Period in Mesoamerica, 900 - 1500

The postclassic period was a result of overpopulation, driving civilizations to compete more heavily for human resources. The Toltecs were one of the first postclassic peoples and they made most of their impact in architecture, politics, and war. The Aztecs were another civilization of Mesoamerica that was heavily involved with military position, rather than blood line, and they practiced the idea of tributes to the ruler. The Aztecs are known for their human sacrifices, but more importantly, they had a merchant class who held near as much power as the nobles.

## Northern Peoples

Irrigation in Northern areas was able to support large crops such as beans and maize which were later introduced into Mesoamerica and allowed for the large population gain that we have already observed in the previous section. The Anasazi communities of the Northern areas had to develop complex irrigation systems, and did, including developing the Mesoamerican ball courts. The Mississippians were called mound builders because of the mound-like structures they created, and they had a system of government that was hereditary with a singular ruler or chieftain holding all of the power and being given many extra luxuries that could not be afforded by the lower class of the community.

## Andean Civilizations, 600 - 1500

The Andean people developed in the Andean mountains in South America and are thought to have been encouraged to find new living methods due to the challenges this environment faced. The Andean experienced consistent freezing as one of its many challenges, had a system of brotherhood that connected people's interests, and had an aristocracy that controlled the government and helped to prevent famines. The Moche were a people who used irrigation like the other civilizations but faced many unpredictable flooding and drought issues that lead to their demise after the rulers lost influence since it was considered their responsibility to keep the forces of nature in order and to protect the balance. The Tiwanaku and Wari were connected civilizations that were interesting because of their small populations. The Inca were prosperous and had a large population, one which they housed in brick and mortar buildings in their large city complexes.

## Diversity and Dominance: Burials as Historical Texts

Much of what we know today about these civilizations comes from the information that was imprinted on materials and goods. For example, pots commonly had artwork on them, and metal pieces consistently had text inscribed in them. Something that also describes to us a lot, is the things that were buried with rulers, such as other humans. Showing the dedication that these individuals had towards their master.

## Environment + Technology: Inca Roads

The Inca in reality improved on already existing roads, without much original constructions. Even through this, these roads, like the roads of Rome, increased the speed at which civilizations could interact with one another, and the ability they had to control their military or distant forces. One of the amazing constructions that were commonly seen due to the mountainous terrain was suspension bridges across crevices. 

## Conclusion

Mesoamerican societies developed some of the first calendars of this area and set down the basic belief systems. The North American civilizations made use of plentiful big harvest crops that allowed for increased population elsewhere. THe Aztec and the Inca empires demonstrated the power of these civilizations in the Americas and the challenges they had to overcome in order to survive, at least for a certain amount of time.

# Reflection

Words = {

crisis: The Mesoamerican civilizations consistently had to concern themselves with reoccurring crises. For example, the Andean region civilizations had little luck with stable farming seasons.

belief: Belief systems that were developed during this time period and in this area demonstrate the technology that these people had available to them. Surprisingly, they were able to increase the position of women in society by giving them the task of important roles such as the shamans of a family.

misleading: Although sacrifices were very common in the Aztec civilization,, it wasn't the only defining feature. This chapter allows us to see how we have decided on these incorrect and narrow minded definitions of what these civilizations in the Americas are really composed of.
