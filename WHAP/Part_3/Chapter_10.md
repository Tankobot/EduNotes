#Inner and East Asia, 600 - 1200 

##The Early Tang Empire, 618 - 755 

Tang China emerged after the Han and took power from the Sui, decentralizing the government enough to keep large land owners happy. Buddhism was very popular in the Tang Empire and was easily adapted as it was translated into many scriptures and was very tolerant with other religious beliefs concerning other gods. The tributary system developed as a way to keep this decentralization under some control and the capital cities gained power through these tributes and trade along multiple routes and networks. Trade increased China's wealth and allowed for the wealthy to indulge in sports such as polo and the idea of noblewomen competing for power amongst each other. 

##Rivals for Power in Inner Asia and China, 600 - 907 

The Tibetan people were one of the extra civilizations that contested against the Tang Empire for control of East Asia, and this conflict caused a large portion of China to have to regroup its efforts for unity and political success. The Tibetan areas became disunified and were exposed to the wrath of the Tang, but instead of being conquered they created an alliance with the Tang and became the controllers of trade routes between Asia and China, even creating their own form of Buddhism. Buddhism encouraged women to uptake influential roles, while Confucianism worked in the opposite manner and believer of Confucianism made women rulers out to be evil, but Buddhism was eventually largely destroyed as a result of Buddhist leader becoming to powerful from tax exemption. Eventually the Tang Empire came to and end when the emperor was overthrown and the empire could not be supported by their military tax income, and in a large event, mass murder was commited to remove all people who were believed to be foreigners or barbarians. 

##The Ermergence of East Asia, to 1200 

After the fall of the Tang multiple new rulers emerged with the Song dynasty being one of them. The empire of the Liao took control over most of Asia but was contested by the Jurchen and Song, with the Jin taking control and turning against the Song. The Song made technological advancements and were greatly influenced by time keeping mechanisms which improved their trade by being able to locate themselves relatively. They also produced huge amounts of iron and developed uses for gunpowder in order to act as a military weapon. Confucianism became very popular among officials and it acted as the deciding factor of people's position in society, as they could take tests to determine their skill in the belief system. After the Song Empire experienced minor collapse they actually encouraged the public to gain wealth through other means, reminiscent of capitalism today, but this lead to greater gender inequality and contributed to the poor position of women in Song society. 

##New Kingdoms in East Asia 

Korea emerged through the support of the Tang Empire, which encouraged one of the Korean occupying powers to take full control of their area, but eventually the Korean rulers lost power when the Tang dynasty fell. The Japanese were another unlikely civilization due to the poor farming conditions of Japan, yet they adapted Chinese techniques for many methods. Even though they adopted a majority of Chinese culture, the Japanese implemented emperors who didn't have power, and eventually a set of military leaders who held all the power for the state. Korea was split among two groups including the Veit and the Champa who both cooperated with the Song, yet didn't adopt the exact culture of China.

##Environment and Technology: Writing in East Asia, 600 - 1200 

Writing in East Asia was an ideographic system. The characters very little represented the sounds for the words or ideas they stood for. The Chinese developed their system of writing while the neighboring civilizations commonly adopted the Chinese writing system while making their own changes as necessary.

China had many networks of trade that helped to pull in information and resources from surrounding civilizations. Major advancements in technology were made, such as the ability to accurately track time were essential to China. The belief systems of Buddhism and Christianity were the most popular options in China, with the later eventually winning over.

	unification: China was repeatedly broken down and reunified. The Sui and Tang are a testament to this cycle of events. China is notorious for being separated by events, whether it was barabrians, or internal conflict. The chapter makes sure that it touches on this subject multiple times, as it is a defining characteristic of China's history. 
	
	beliefSystem: Belief systems were hugely popular in China. Specifically Buddhism and Confucianism, with the latter being the most popular. Buddhism caused many monastaries to be built but eventually destroyed during the backlash of Buddhism, and Confucianism was used as a system to maintain government and personal ideals. 
	
	technology: China developed a variety of technologies. THe most influential of the time was probably the advances in agriculture, as they allowed for increased food production and the population of large cities.
