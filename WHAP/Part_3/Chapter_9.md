#Christian Europe Emerges, 600 - 1200 

##The Byzantine Empire, 600 - 1200 

The rulers of the Byzantine Empire slowly took on the role of both the emperor, and the leader of the Christian church. The Eastern Empire had to deal with many issues including pressure from invaders and the loss of territory by Islamic peoples who reduced the power of the Christian government. The Byzantine Empire slowly deteriorated as the wealthy maintained their income but the poor faced greater hardship and less protection from the government. The empire made great achievements in art and a language under the name of Cyrillic developed in Russia. 

##Early Medieval Europe, 600 - 1000 

The western empire broke down into what is now early medieval Europe, and it was connected with the idea of weak people being supported by the efforts of strong people. The area of medieval Europe divided into France, the middle areas, and Germany, which were consistently invaded by Vikings from the Swedes. Villages developed out of what used to be government maintained areas, and people devoted themselves to lords that provided small protection and management over their lands. The system that these people used has been clasified under the name feudalism, in which every owns and gives out property in return for loyalty to them. 

##The Western Church 

The Western Church became very connected to papal decisions but had a difficult time in executing the pope's commands and regulations due to disorder, and the lack of information transportation. The Church and the Kings were consistently at ends with each other, as they contested for power over one another, with each having small victories and losses, but neither taking full control. Monastaries emerged and provided a place for people of lower class to recieve protection but cause problems for the upper levels of the Church as they couldn't monitor the people of the monastaries. 

##Kievan Russia, 900 - 1200 

Kievan Russia initially was associated with Europe more than the Muslim world and the area it occupied was continually controlled by a large number of princes who had small amounts of power each. Eventually a man name Vladimir made himself the grand prince of Russia and adopted Orthodox Christianity instead of other religious platforms. The Christian system of government sent new people to the Russian frontier to control religious actions and caused Russia to seclude itself from the Islamic world, limiting Islam's spread. Russia was unable to create large cities due to their food restraints but instead focused on the arts and worked on skills such as glass making. They ran into the issue of polytheism consistently rising up in their areas, but eventually Christianity succeded and became the common religion. 

##Western Europe Revives, 1000 - 1200 

Technological changes drastically increased the productivity of Europe, with one such example being the new plow that was able to till the harder clays of Europe, and the new horse harnesses, which allowed for horses to better pull plows through soil, and allow the farmers to grow more crops quickly and to create surplusses that spurred population growth. Cities expanded to the point in which they could no longer be contained by past walls and had to build new walls, signaling the increase of trade and the increase of coinage as trade required its presence. 

##The Crusades, 1095 - 1204 

Pilgrimages gave insight into the going ons of the Islamic areas and eventually the Christian powers of the north decided that they could no longer prevent themselves from wanting regain control of holy areas in the south, leading to the First Crusade, in which Jerusalem was captured by Christian powers, but after the next three crusades, was recaptured by Muslim people. The Crusades helped to introduce new technologies and areas of philosophy into Christian controlled areas, as the intellectual property from Muslim areas was diffused into these new places. 

##Diversity and Dominance: Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg and the Christianization of the Scandinavians and Slavs 

The was a strong connection between religious matters and political structures in Europe. The Archbishop Adalbert was a very smart man who was giving towards the poor yet strict on the rich. He was enraged by kings who broke from the Christian methodology and who took on extra wives and concubines. Slavia eventually saw most of its population being converted to Christianity. 

##Environment + Technology: Cathedral Organs 

Cathedral organs are a big part of the church image of today but were not as common in past eras. When they emerged they had to powered by air from laborers who continually worked to provide the wind neccessary for the instrument to sound. They initially had large keys that had to be pounded with force in order to work. The keys eventually became smaller and now they are able to produce amazing musical pieces. 

##Conclusion 

After the Roman Empire fell and was split, Europe was never able to completely reunite their region and collect into a single power. The church and the secular rulers were continually at ends and never met unification leading to the consistency of tension within their ranks. Both Orthodox Christianity and Catholic Christianity grew in popularity and neither one was able to suppress the other out of existence. The emergence of new technologies allowed for the creation of greater cities. And the Crusades allowed for Muslim Chrisitian civilizations to interact more deeply and share greater amounts of knowledge. 

#Reflection 

words {

* Power: Although power is a very general term, here I think it best describes the power conflict between the Church and secular rulers who throughout this chapter had difficulty on agreeing on the powers that each other held. This kept tension in places that could've otherwise lived in piece under a simple ruling system. 
* War: The Crusades marked a key point in the history of Europe. They lead to Jerusalem remaining under the control of the Islamic people, and the reignited interest of the European areas in the collection of technologies and information from Greece and the Middle East. 
* Church: During the course of this chapter, the church: split between the Western Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Church, caused competition between political powers, spread its beliefs to Russia, lead to the creation of monastaries for smaller communities, and laid the foundation for the system on control that spread out over its own reaches.
