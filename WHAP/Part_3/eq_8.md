Includes opinions not directly taken from factual documents.

1. Mecca was an important religious and cultural/economic center because it was home to a group of idols and later was the origin of Islam. It acted as a caravan city and because of the strong religious influence people visited the area more often and brought in greater commerce.

2. The Ka'ba used to hold a variety of gods. Until the shrine was destroyed by Islamic peoples later in the history of Mecca, the shrine acted as a common place for people of separate beliefs to practice their faith in the same area. In the same way, the different branches of Christianity all share similar roots even though they are different.

3. A Muslim is an individual who practices the Islamic faith and submits to Allah. An Arab on the other hand lives in or around the region of Arabia.

4. It's accurate to say that these people all share characteristics because most of them acted as prophets who communicated what god or the gods really desired for actions on Earth. They acted as messengers that carried information from god to the people. Another similarity is that they all had a large following of people, at least by the end of their life, that believed in the word that they were spreading to surrounding peoples.

5. Islam and Muslim are both terms in Arabic that relate to the submission. Specifically here though, they communicate that a person has submitted to God, and is following the Islamic faith.

6. Now I would assume that Mecca is more important as the Ka'ba lies there and the Ka'ba is one of the most important religious structures for Islamic faith. Medina on the hand might have once been the most important city. It acted as the home of Islam for a period after the area of Mecca forced out Muslims. Medina was the center of Islam for a small amount of time, until Muslims eventually regained Mecca and spread farther.

7. The umma is a community controlled region and population. Another aspect is that the umma only controls a certain region. The caliphate though acts as the leader of the entire Islamic population. The caliphate is not limited to a specific area, instead they act as the entire overruling leader.

8. Muhammad's revelations were considered more perfect because they were claimed to be latest revelation and they were going to be the last revelations that would be revealed by god. If someone was a believer of this idea, they would also believe that god favored Muhammad as the messenger. He also encouraged the idea of reform over the idea of providing donations to the faith. The ideas had not gone through a long editing process.

9. Muhammad had a message that was very similar to Jesus of Nazareth. They stressed that the lower end of society were the most important people, and that they would be favorable in the eyes of god. This is very popular as a majority of the population belongs to the lower end.

10. The Five Pillars encourage practices that are similar to the methods the Muhammad practiced whilst he was receiving information from god and this ensures that the people of Islam can best bring themselves closer to god. The Five Pillars are also important in connecting people to Muhammad because it acts as a consistent reminder of the contribution that Muhammad had towards the religion.

11. Muhammad was the original prophet, and his word was believed to be the word of god, which the followers of Islam understood as such. A caliph on the other hand did not speak in the name of god, as Muhammad foretold that he was to be the last prophet and that there would no others. The caliph had influence over the Islamic population but only politically, not religiously.

12. Abu Bakr started the writing of the words of god into a compiled text. He made this text with the help of a specialized team and called it the Qu'ran. This was the first time an entire compilation of Muhammad's words that came from Allah were recorded into a standard writing that could be preserved for longer amounts of time.

13. The Qur'an is the word of god that was spoken and transposed between the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad.

14. The people of the book include a majority of the Abrahamic religions. It includes these religions and is important because Muslims have historically given higher rights to people of the book. Even though the people weren't fully committed the Islamic faith specifically they were considered to be at a higher level than people who practiced completely independent belief systems.

15. The Sunnis would be consistently arguing with the Shiites over the rightful leader of Islam. I would eventually be able to calm everyone down by giving them the idea that neither of their prospective leaders is currently with us today, so we should agree that we might have had differences in the past, but the now is more important.

16. It tore the community apart, because they had always been united underneath Muhammad but with him out of the picture and not leaving any instructions for the selection of a new leader, the state had nobody to consult when the time came for a caliph to become the new ruler. The caliph position was therefore fought for, in the same way that the position of emperor was chased after.

17. That would be an accurate title for the caliph because he was famous for the areas that he gained for the people of the Islamic faith. Even though the religion gained these new areas, along with the people that resided in those areas, they still encouraged a form of religious tolerance that was rare in these areas of the world, and for any religion in general.

18. The Umayyad caliphate prevented non-Muslims from achieving the same position as their Muslim counterparts. They eventually replaced the positions of the government with supporters of their own caliphate that existed. They provided little room for new powers to exist, until the caliphate got the upper hand and brought down the caliphate.

19. The people were discontent with the Umayyad caliphate because it was restricting the people who currently presided in the Islamic area but weren't converts to occupy lower positions in society, and prevent the social mobility that had kept a fair amount of peace within the regions that had Islamic rulers.

20. Abassid period encouraged increased proposals of education that scholars could take advantage of in order to further advance the technologies of the area. Advances were made in a variety of subjects, such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. They also encourage advancements by allowing the transmission of ideas from outside areas such as Greece instead of isolating themselves from outside information.

21. The caliphs could not protect their large empire while enlisting only the help of the native population. They were required to bring in new outside resources in order to satisfy their military needs. The issue with this is that the new army has little connection with the cause they are attempting to fight for, leading them to become not as invested in their efforts.

22. The Imam or the caliph were very important to the Buyid Shi'ites because they gave the Muslim community that believed in their right to rule a sense of unification and provided the Islamic people with the strength to make larger decisions while one person acted as the representative.

23. They separated themselves from the other Islamic kingdoms and like other rulers they claimed to be direct descendents of the prophet's son-in-law. After the Abbasid fell to opposing forces, multiple people stepped in to claim a piece of the power that was left out in the open, and because of this the Islamic community was separated. The ulama would disagree with this action because they were scholars that strived to unify Islamic umma.

24. By 1200 C.E. Islam was practiced in Northern Africa, Southern Spain, Arabia, Persia, and the Middle East.

25. Islam was primarily diffused through the conquering of new areas. When a new place was conquered by one of the caliphs currently in power, the new government that was established would bring the Islamic faith with them. This new faith would be diffused into the surrounding cultures rather than injected into and forced to replace.

26. The Shahan-shah was the king of the kings and originated from Persia, while the Sultan was a an Arabian ruler of power. The king of kings controlled a large number of smaller officials who they themselves controlled lands. The Sultan on the other hand usually held direct control with their lands, and maintained the status of all the peoples of their lands, instead of managing larger sub-Slutans.

27. The Seljuk Turks established a new Muslim state that was based on the Turks, and they continually put pressure on the Islamic community and the caliph. People tended to remain neutral when conflicts were occurring and it was encouraged to practice this concept of neutrality, even when problems were damaging the people of the region.

28. Both the Christian Crusades and Mongol invasion both impacted the Muslim world by putting military pressure on the regions of the time. Many Islamic kingdoms had to stretch their funds even thinner as warriors on their doorsteps sucked their wallets dry. After a loss of money, some governments would switch to hired mercenaries, but this usually is a mistake as mercenaries have an easy time capturing a country they don't care for.

29. It taught people how a member of the Islamic community should act when in the presence of others. It also gave people insight into the beliefs that they were practicing and the life of someone they could better understand as a real person, and not just some imaginary figure or abstract concept that they have to put trust into.

30. The Sharia like any set of laws can give people the feeling that they understand what they should expect based on the actions they have committed. They don't have to feel worried that the rules will change based on the feeling of the ruler at that current moment.

31. One of the large reasons that many people converted to Islam was because their was a very easy method for joining the religion. You only had to profess to god a series of prayers and then you would be considered a Muslim. Another strong factor was that being Islamic had economical benefits. Many Muslim controlled areas gave better benefits when it came to taxes if you belonged to the Islamic faith.

32. It didn't develop within the empire because Muhammad had described that no Muslim could have another Muslim as a slave. In the same idea, no Muslim could have a person who belonged to an Abrahamic religion as a slave. The idea being that if I child has not yet committed to a religion it does not deserve to be turned into a slave, as even slaves who became Muslims could become free.

33. Muslim women had greater rights than Christian or Jewish women as they were allowed to inherit property and were allowed to keep the property even after marrying a husband. They could testify in courts of law and they could divorce a man with given reason and could be paid a sum of money after the divorce.

34. Muslim men feared that their women would commit sexual acts with other people not specific to just the single male. They also feared that the women of society might attempt to commit actions with concern to politics and for a few reasons many men did not find it acceptable to allow women to make political decisions or practice infidelity.

35. Two ways that Iranians impacted the Islamic faith include: They brought forward the ideas of large educational institutions for the study of religion among other subject. And, they helped to develop the idea of Sufi brotherhoods that could help to unify smaller groups of Muslims and provide people with organizations for discussion.

36. Both baseball and football are sports which have fans that attend the games in the same way that churches and mosques have communities that attend the prayers at the specified times, in the same way that these sports have specified times. 

37. In some aspects it might have similarities but for the most part it contains greater differences. The Sunna is a collection of information that describes how the prophet lived his life and gives others an example on what they could model their life on. The Torah on the other hand is collections of texts from many places and sources.

38. Ramadan has been popular for a long period of time and has maintained this popularity to this day. It has been described as the period of fasting to celebrate the day that Muhammad received his first revelation. The date is centered around this event and is therefore honoring the event that brought about the Islamic faith that they now honor every day.

39. The art style resembles the Arabic language and in this way it connects itself with worship of Allah. The art style came about as a result of cultural diffusion since the art is commonly used to easily spread the culture of Islam across longer areas of land and over the world. An example of the art is: (Wikimedia.org:Arabesque) ![art](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Turquoise_epigraphic_ornament_MBA_Lyon_A1969-333.jpg)
