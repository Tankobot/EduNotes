#From the Origins of Agriculture to the First River-Valley Civilizations 8000 - 1500 B.C.E. 

##Before Civilization 

Before civilization there was the Paleolithic and Neolithic time period, home to the first humans who developed early agriculture and learned to cook their food. The Agricultural Revolution struck and suddenly we see many tools being produced for the purpose of farming and the production of corn was probably one of the most popular plants to grow as it produced resources such as food and beer. Life in Neolithic communities became popular as farmers outnumbered nonfarmers, one reason being that farmer communities were stronger in terms of relationships, and we saw the emergence of the first permanent buildings being placed down in the Middle East. In Mesopotamia communities developed around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which developed tools and methods for living around the unstable landscape, one of the civilizations living near their was the Sumerians, which represent the beginning of modern history as they kept records in their written language. City-states began to develop and in connection religion and authority figures also came about, kings and priests being some of the most popular, held a majority of the control over an area with the king being a diety's representative, one of the popular kings was Hammurabi, known for his law code. 

**Cuneiform was invented during this time, in Mesopotamia.** 

##Egypt 

The Nile is the key to the Egyptian civilization as it is the largest river in the world and is the only one flowing through the local area, with unpredictable floods that destroyed large amounts of land, and droughts that left land infertile for growing. The Egyptians needed rulers and their decision was to have Pharoahs who acted as the king, eventually requesting that large structures, Pyramids, be created so as to preserve themselves and their name. The Egyptians developed a form of writing known as Heiroglyphics and they invented papyrus, as a paper, also trading with neighboring civilizations and conquering Nubia in order to gain gold fields. Slaves and women of Egypt had greater rights and fairer treatment than in many other areas of the world, as slaves had the oppurtunity to be released and women could retain ownership over property if they decided to leave their partner. Re was the top god of the Egyptians and kings represented Horus, the son of Re, and as you read before, wanted their name to be preserved, for both real life, and the afterlife, quarrying great rocks, clearing large areas, and dragging stones into place in order to build their pyramids. 

**There was initially two separate kingdoms, upper and lower.**

##The Indus Valley Civilization 

The Indus Valley was home to the Indus River which overflowed annually and fertilized the soil while staying nearly dry for the rest of the year, yet still allowing two harvests of crops per year. The Indus Valley civilization created a language consisting of hundreds of symbols that was used to express words and syllables, and they also developed cities that were in a rectangular pattern, and they demonstrated knowledge of how to sign art and how to mix metals of different compositions. The downfall of the Indus Valley civilization is thought to be caused either by social breakdown or by the river drying up for too long and increasing the salt content in the ground, preventing plants from growing. 

##Diversity and Dominance 

This section is describing a Babylonian New Year's festival and is also depicting the story of their god who punished a wrongdoer and turned her body into the world we know today. It then describes how Babylon is to be the home of the gods. We learn that a god is punished for attempting to stir up controversy between the gods. The idea was that the New Year's festival would please the gods and would lead to a more fruitful year. 

##Environment + Technology: Environmental Stress on the Indus Valley

The Indus Valey was thought to be wetter and more pleantiful in the third millenium, contributing towards the civilizations there. Now it is thought that during the second millenium the valley became drier and arid, conditions that have conrinued up to the present. The discovery of old river beds demonstrate the immense loss of suitable land, likely leading to the desertion of cities and villages. All of this information added together and we are able to see that it was than just technical change that lead to the downfall of the Indus civilization. 

##Conclusion 

Productive rivers were one of the great contributors towards agriculture, as more people took up and adopted the way of life. The Mesopotamians relied on the two river, Tigris and Euphrates. The Egyptians relied on the Nile and had a ruler who was divine and instituted a large concept of religion while also giving better rights to people such as slaves and women. The Indus Valley civilization relied on the Indus river and all of these civilizations eventually met their downfall. 

#Reflection 

words = {
	Agriculture: Agriculture spread throughout the world, specifically the area concerning this chapter, and was adopted by a multitude of people, gaining dominance over foragers. 
	Fall: Every society discussed in this chapter met their downfall and this shows us a lot about the cycle of history and how certain subjects continue to repeat. 
	Water: Every civilization in this chapter was only prevelent because of the water supply that nearby rivers produced, and without this water farming wouldn't have been able to grow in popularity and support large populations.
