#The Mediterranean and Middle East, 2000 - 500 B.C.E. 

##The Cosmopolitan Middle East, 1700 - 1100 B.C.E. 

The cosmopoliton era was the Late Bronze Age in the Middle East, in which many ideas and cultures were being shared between people. After a long period of time, the Egyptians succumbed to the Hyksos, who were able to take control of Egypt mostly due to their military power and farther advanced technologies. Later, the Hyksos were pushed out of Egypt once more, and Egyptians regained control while also expanding outwards into new territories while under the rule of the first female pharaoh Hatshepsut. Now we move onto to Akhenaten, who decided to attempt to instate his own religion in Egypt in order to give better control to the royal family, after he died officials and his own son, Tutankhamun, resinstated the old polytheistic religion. Finally we arrive on Ramesses II, who was was well known for building great monuments and fathering many children, horses were also introduced, providing rapid transportation of information and resources, allowing for larger areas of control. 

##The Aegean World, 2000 - 1100 B.C.E. 

The Minoan civilization, was one of the first societies to occupy Crete and had a beneficial idea of the natural world, although it is possible that the stylized art is only representative of the higher-class and that the lower lived a tougher life than perceived. The Mycenaeans are considered to have been farther along technologically than the Minoans and built large cities in stategic areas with strong fortifications. The Mycenaeans kept strict records of nearly all things having to do with the economy, demonstrating a very organized government, although it is odd that nothing is said of information pertaining to religion or rulers. The Mycenaeans had an amazing method of trade by taking advantage of the ocean around them, they were able to transport goods between different areas, and pirate resources from weaker vessels. The Bronze Age eventually fell and turned into the Dark Age, as many civilizations began to lose power and decentralized force created poverty and a loss of the sharing of knowledge. 

##The Assyrian Empire, 911 - 612 B.C.E 

The Neo-Assyrian Empire rose to power and overtook many if not all of the largest civilizations before it including Babylon and Egypt. The king of this specific empire was considered to be the reprenstative of god on Earth and he was assumed to be above everyone else, acting as a military, foreign affairs, and economic leader, he secured his role through demonstration of victory convincing people of its reality. The Assyrians were also very dependent on conquest on pillage, as most of their work force was provided by prisoners of war, and most of their wealth was produced by procuring valuables from the territories they gained control of. Although the empire did contain slaves, unlike most slave civilizations the Assyrians refered to all classes as "human beings" and allowed for people of lower to rise up through the ranks. 

`Side Note: The Assyrians also had many scholars who persued subjects such as medicine, math, and astronomy.`

##Israel, 2000 - 500 B.C.E. 

Israel is the home of the Israelites, and "is a crossroads, linking Anatolia, Egypt, Arabia, and Mesopotamia" and has few natural resources. We learn that historians have been using the Hebrew Bible as one of primary sources for information and use it to compare to archaeological findings, Abraham was apparently the first Jew, he made Israel his home, Israelites were made into slaves in Egypt (exclusiveness is disputed), and they were eventually freed by Moses. Eventually Israel's power was passed to David and then to Solomon who existed during the high-point of Israel, and as Israel became more urbanized the classes became more distinct and women lost equality among men. Israel was eventually split into Israel and Judah, the latter lasting nearly a century longer but eventually yielding to the Assyrian Empire and causing the Jews to be dispersed into many areas where, they tended to stay and developed communities with strict rules. 

##Phoenicia and the Mediterranean, 1200 - 500 B.C.E. 

The people who inhabited Syria-Palestine are called Phoenicians. One of the strongest city-states, named Tyre, had large access to natural resources and monopolized the coastal trade of its area in the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians established colonies on Cyprus and were able to control all of the Mediterranean once they occupied all of Sicily but like most, if not all civilizations, they fell to another power, the Assyrian army. Carthage was a Phoenician city that was powerful, had an ethnically diverse population, had a strong navy, and an ordered government of elected officials that voted on issues and decision. Carthage had a very weak military of citizens, instead relying primarily on mercenaries in order to fight their wars. 

##Failure and Transormation, 750 - 550 B.C.E. 

Assyria lost power as they lost wealth while trying to maintain large borders. They were pressured by neighboring civilizations who were on the rise including the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which absorbed most of Assyria. The Babylonians underwent a time of great succession, eventually becoming the largest metropolis in the world at the time. 

##Environment + Technology: Ancient Textiles and Dyes 

Throughout history, up until modern times, textile production has been a job usually secured by women of a household since it didn't require consistent attention. Women in Peru however started sharing ideas, and were able to develop better methods of textile production. In Tyre, one major export was cloth that was died with Tyrian purple. The dye came from a rare snail, and in small amounts. Because of this, it became a business occupied by more than just women who produced these expensive fabrics. 

##Diversity and Dominance: An Israelite Prophet Chastizes the Ruling Class 

Israel started off as an unorganized group of people who shared a common belief. This quickly grew into a complex society. A consequence of this change was the ability for the rich to become more separated from the poor. This to public outcry from a few individuals who believed that the current Israel was going to be punished for being so corrupt in the eyes of their god. 

##Conclusion 

During this chapter we have realized that many conquerors, while taking control of an area, usually adopted the culture of the people who lived there previously. Trade was a key part of this chapter since it describes the benefits brought about by the movement of information. We also learned how the Assyrians method of relocating their prisoners of war only worked to a certain extant but eventually lead to their downfall. And, how this dispersion of people from their areas of origin lead to new unique cultures. 

#Reflection 

Topic: Change

Description: I believe that the topic of this chapter can be selected as change because of the empires and civilizations prevelent in the text. First, the Assyrian Empire was a great change to many societies, as it was a very centralized power civilization, and it forced other to change their ways in order to adapt their own. Another civilization that underwent change was Israel, as it switched hands multiple times, and transformed its societal structure on numerous occasions. For example, when one of its population thought that class destinctions were becoming too prevelent and decided to encourage a reform in the government.
