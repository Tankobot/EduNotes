# Africa, India, and the New British Empire, 1750 - 1870

## Changes and Exchanges in Africa

One change that occurred in Africa included the emergence of new African states such as the Zulu kingdom who were able to rise as new forms of weaponry flooded into the region from places such as Europe, also leading to leaders such as the Sokoto Caliphate, which grew to become one of the largest states in Africa. Another consequence of the new exchanges in Africa included the modernization of various African and Egyptian states as rulers such as Muhammad Ali began to modernize their countries in an attempt to compete with the dominating European states. In response to these changes European states began to move in on African regions and began to obtain control in Africa, these European states included France and Britain. After these intrusions began to settle down new ideas and new morals emerged which opened Africa up to expanded legitimate trade of goods besides slaves. In fact, many internal empires emerged very successfully by taking advantage of Africa's previously large slave supply and using this labor force in Africa to create large trade networks.

## India Under British Rule

One problem that began to show itself in India was the lack of a centralized power as the Mughal Empire lost control and power shifted into the hands of the few strong nobles such as the nawabs, roughly resembling Feudal Europe as these individual nobles each held private armies in an attempt to balance their powers. As Britain extended its control further into the roots of India's government and politics they began to institute new reforms that tried to model India after Britain and their own government, which gave extra power to the superiors of India while taking power from the peasants. One of the new political reforms put power into the hands of the Indian Civil Service which still maintained loyalty to the British Queen who was named the Empress of India, where industrial reform brought new forms of transportation such as trains to Indian markets. A new idea began to emerge that started to unify India as nationalism brought people together and helped to institute political reforms such as child marriage, all of this leading to the Indian National Congress.

## Britain's Eastern Empire

In the eastern reaches of the world Britain began to put greater emphasis on their colonies and commerce while they had to compete with their European rivals that included both the French and Dutch who fought for global commercial domination. An important part to note about Britain and the colonies that they began to establish all across the globe was that they were not extremely interested in collecting vast territories but instead they were actually interested in only acquiring colonies that would gain them quick and massive benefits. One colony that Britain began to populate was called Australia and although it was first used as a place to dispose of British prisoners it later discovered the presence of gold and eventually became a large British colony in its own right. All of these new and emerging colonies required some source to retrieve their labor from and indentured servitude was the go to form for an aspiring European, as they began to flood away from Europe to work for several years in remote lands in exchange for free passage and a place to live for their working time.

## Diversity and Dominance: Ceremonials of Imperial Domination

As Britain began to push their influences into their new Indian areas they began to replace the Indian politics and governments. And one of the key parts of this government was creating a new loyalty to the Queen of Britain who was being crowned the Empress of India. Sadly for Britain, their military might was not enough to convince their Indian sub rulers who of which they had to win over the loyalty of if they wanted to have a chance of maintaining a strong rule in India. A letter from Edward Robert Bulwerlytton to the Queen described to her the importance of creating alliances with the people such as the nawabs. 

## Environment and Technology: Whaling

Whaling became a huge part of the international economy, since whales contained a variety of expensive yet useful resources that were sold everywhere. Even during this time period though people were opposed to the killing of these giant beasts but their qualms had very little effect on the business. Moby Dick describes how people disliked the concept even though they still purchased the goods. As the importance of whaling increased so did the practice, and along with the practice came new inventions to make the process even more efficient, including innovations such as gunpowder propelled harpoons.

## Conclusion

Although the beginning of this chapter starts us in the region of Africa where British exports and European exports in general were quickly reeking havoc upon the local populations, the majority of this time period is spent focused on the movements of the British. The British, who for many years were nothing more than a small European state with a few remote colonies quickly grew into a dominating world power. This domination became a reality after the British experienced the greater part of an industrial revolution which pushed their economy and the associated manufactures leagues ahead of global competitors. Britain began to spread like a bug across the entire globe, extending its political ideas into new regions such as India, Australia, and New Zealand, just to name a few. Britain was the major manufacturer, importer, and exporter of the entire globe.

# Reflection

words {

Exploitation: The British were a clear example of a very strong people that were using their strength and influence in order to benefit themselves off of the backs of their inferiors. This included but was not limited to India and the indigenous people of places such as Australia and New Zealand.

Change: In regards to Africa, the new imports that were arriving from their European trading neighbors proved to be a consequence for the region as the inflow of weapons began to separate African leaders and began to decentralize power. In addition, this lead to even more British ideas finding their way into Africa's politics which spelled benefits for British manufacturers.

Industry: Industry is undeniably the major driving force behind Britain's actions during this time period. After the industrial revolution, Britain was propelled into the global markets and its various businesses required new areas to expand into. So with the help of new technologies, Britain expanded itself into new lands in the hopes of creating new trading utopias. In a lot of ways, they succeeded, repopulating Australia and bringing their influences into India and Asia.
