# Revolutionary Changes in the Atlantic World, 1750 - 1850

## Prelude to Revolution: The Eighteenth-Century Crisis

Wars began to emerge between different powers that existed between Europe and the most popular of these tensions was between that of the Netherlands and the British attacking various Spanish colonies in the Americas. One event to arise from these tensions and conflict was the Enlightenment which included great minds such as Copernicus and was the inspiration for the Industrial revolution that Europe would eventually experience. One of the most important ideas to come from the Enlightenment though were those about state power, specifically concerning the power of monarchs versus the people that lived in a state and these ideas spread from Europe to the Americas as well. Even though many monarchs attempted to enact changes that they thought would satisfy their peoples, these changes rarely succeeded and instead gave the people even more reason to rebel against what they believed to be unjust powers.

## The American Revolution, 1775 - 1800

One of the causes for the American Revolution, and likely the most prominent cause, were the taxes that were being imposed on American settlers by their foreign powers, for example the British which heavily taxed settlers in an effort to keep good trade with the Amerindians. Another example of the Britain's poor attempt to establish power through taxes was with the Stamp Act which angered many colonists because it put unnecessary taxes on all documents, and this eventually lead to the Boston massacre which put colonists on the tipping point. The new revolution that was emerging was characterized as being heroic because it was centered on colonial leaders and the people of the colonies electing said leaders in order to better represent them and to take control of internal affairs. One of the main goals of the American Revolution was to provide the power of the state to the people that lived within it, and the Constitutional Convention was a group of leaders who began meeting in order to "render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union."

## The French Revolution, 1789 - 1815

The French revolution began as direct result of the people's disagreement with the wealth gradient that existed between the rich and the poor, which at this time were so stark that the church and nobles owned and incredible 40% of France. The Estates General was a slightly more representative system than the monarch and was eventually called together to help reform the king's decisions but this was futile and eventually constitutional monarchy was enacted by the National Assembly which consisted of elected officials, also enacting other improvement to French legislature, such as the Rights of Men, which gave freedom of speech to most people. The event that put the nail in the coffin of the absolute monarchy was the king and queen's attempt to flee France which spelled treason in the eyes of their subjects, leading to both their imprisonment and the popular support of radical democrats called Jacobins. Instead of creating democracy though, the revolution lead to Popular Authoritarianism.

## Revolution Spreads, Conservatives Respond, 1789 - 1850

After word of the revolutions such as the French Revolution reached other parts of the world, specifically the parts of the world that were under the control of the French, revolution entered the minds of all and new problems such as the Haitian Revolution emerged and took root, putting an ever increasing strain on the French government. After the success of Haitian Revolution, European powers were extremely worried about losing their own control and because of this fear they established the Congress of Vienna and Holy Alliances in an attempt to protect themselves from government changes. In order to combat these new defenses the revolutionaries took advantage of nationalism in order to rally up many individuals and convince the people that revolution was a national effort that benefited the people of their country, which it usually did.

## Environment and Technology: The Pencil

Original pencils were supplied by proprietary materials such as lead which eventually became superseded by materials like the commonly used graphite. A reoccurring problem though was that governments tended to restrict the production of graphite in order to keep the prices of said material high. After being enlisted by the government of France, a scientist produced a method where you could mix small amounts of graphite with the cheap resource clay in order to produce usable pencils, and now these pencils are in common use today. 

## Diversity and Dominance: Robespierre and Wollstonecraft Defend and Explain the Terror

The Terror of France is collectively the period during the French Revolution in which countless people of power including nobles, and the King and Queen were publicly executed because of the feelings of the people. Some believed that these atrocities were worse than the crimes committed by the nobility of before. Others believe instead that these deaths were justified due to the sheer amount of unjust decisions of the before. The Terror was a driving force for the French Revolution because it both inspired the bloodlust and revenge of the poor, but also the hatred of the nobles and their awesome power.

## Conclusion

The numerous revolutions that emerged around the world during this time was a result of a multitude of factors with the most prevalent one being the mistreatment of common people. Kings and Queens and monarchs of many kinds usually had an undesirable way of dealing with those who resented their power, using force to suppress unwanted opinions. This only works for so long, and in the case of slaves in Haiti, oppression can lead to a stronger will to rebel and a stronger will to fight. Another major piece of revolutionary inspiration comes from the success stories of others. When people saw other peoples of other lands succeeding in their goals of reform, that would inspire them to rebel and to attempt revolution in their own bounds.

# Reflection

Words {

Revolution: Just because the word is obvious does not mean that it isn't the right one to use, as revolution perfectly describes the changes that were occurring all over the world when people had enough of the oppression that pushed down on their rights and their say within the areas n which they lived.

Enlightenment: The Enlightenment was also another hugely important part of the revolutions that were taking place in Europe, as the enlightenment brought new ideas about the way governments should be managed to the surface of thought. The Enlightenment also allowed for these new ideas to be transferred in ways never before possible, such as printing.

Inspiration: Inspiration was probably the final action that began revolutions. After people who lived in an oppressed state were able to observe those who rebelled against their leaders from other states, these original people found the courage within themselves to fight back against their own oppressors and to make their own revolution in the image of others.
