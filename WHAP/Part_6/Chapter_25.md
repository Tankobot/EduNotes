# Land Empires in the Age of Imperialism, 1800 - 1870

## The Ottoman Empire

One of the key factors that contributed to the change in the Ottoman Empire is directly associated with their involvement in Egypt, where the ruler Muhammad Ali was continually pushing for reforms that would allow Egypt to compete with the other European powers. Sadly, there were members of Ottoman society that were heavily opposed to these new reforms, and they were the Janissaries, who relied on their military power to maintain political power. One of the sultans, Mahmud, implemented a reform known as the Tanzimat, which hoped to model the new Ottoman Empire under European ideas and this quickly changed the way the Ottoman government functioned. Another event that pushed for Ottoman reforms were various wars that the Ottomans had to deal with, this included wars such as the Crimean War which tested the powers and unity of the Ottomans against the Russians.

## The Russian Empire

Russia was very similar to the Ottomans in the fact that they both desired to conform their governments to model those of the powerful European states and they believed that if they accomplished this goal they could revive their own economies and states, one of the groups pushing these changes was the Salvophiles. One of the problems that the Russians had to deal with was their smaller states like those of Dagestan, Chechnya, and Abkhazia splitting away from the larger country for independence. After Russia suffered numerous defeats, these poor feelings laid down the groundwork for new Russian leaders to step in a performs massive reforms in order to revive the Russian people and to put Russia back on the playing field of the global game, and by the end of Nicholas' rule, Russia was well on its way to becoming an international power.

## The Qing Empire

The Qing Empire began becoming extremely notorious for occupying large numbers of corrupt officials, and this lead to a majority of the population feeling as if their government could not be trusted, allowing for them to feel okay giving control to local militias and the sort, keeping the government out of power. Later the Opium Wars have been cited as a demonstration of the weak standing of the Bannermen, who likened themselves to the Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire, in that they terribly outdated and needed to undergo reform. After falling victim to these wars China eventually had to submit to new treaties established for the British which put them under direct British influence. Later the Taiping Rebellion emerged as peoples of China became angry with the poor treatment that they had to endure, causing small leaders to grow and one such to develop a new religious sect that began to dominate the Qing Empire.

## Diversity and Dominance: The French Occupation of Egypt

Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti was a member of the ulama and he formulated responses to the declarations from the French ruler Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon issued documents to the Egyptian people that attempted to convince them that he had their best interests in mind and that he was actually helping to put down their previously oppressive government. Al-Jabarti disagrees with this assertion because he feels that the French ruler is not the Egyptians' best interest but indeed a misrepresentation, due to the unjust courts that the French created and the "unacceptable" laws that they enforced.

## Environment and Technology: The Web of War

The Web of War describes the influences that new information put into the governments involved with said wars. New papers and communication options reduced the time required to move information about global events around the world, and in turn kept citizens better informed about their regions. In addition to this, increased media allowed for the emergence of people such as women to become popular in the public eye as they got more focus in places such as war hospitals. One of these women was Florence Nightingale, who made big changes to war hospitals and was later acknowledged for her contributions.

## Conclusion

Many empires such as the Ottoman Empire, Russia, and the Qing Empire were not aware that they would have to begin enacting heavy reforms if they wanted to have defenses against European domination which was quickly spreading throughout the world. Various wars such as the Crimean War and that of the Opium Wars were demonstrations that showed land empire leaders how vulnerable they really were against the new and emerging European powers. All of the land empires were fighting for different reasons, with the Chinese attempting to maintain power in the field of trade, the Ottomans trying to preserve culture while the European pressured for their rights, and the Russians for being pushed back because of unequal rights territorial encroachment.

# Reflection

words {

Reform: Reform was a major part of this chapter because we observed the Ottomans, the Russians, and the Chinese all enact various forms of reform in their respective countries, and these new political as well as economic changes determined the history and time line of the empires to come.

Instability: Various empires suffered from instability but the empires in this chapter suffered the most, with empires such as China becoming synonymous with corruption among its very own people. In addition, China began to break down as individuals in the state found their own followings and overtook the traditional powers.

Submission: Submission played a large role during this time period, as empires such as the Ottomans had to submit to the European presence that was ever more forceful in their occupation. This pushed the Ottomans to adopt new cultural ideas, inherited from Europe. In China, the Qing government was forced to submit to the British after the Opium Wars, and it crippled the Chinese government powers for years to come.
