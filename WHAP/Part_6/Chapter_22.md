# The Early Industrial Revolution, 1760 - 1851

## Causes of the Industrial Revolution

The largest factor that contributed to the Industrial Revolution in Europe was the increase in populations all around Europe, for example, the populations of England and Whales grew by about fifteen million in one hundred an fifty years. The second part of spurring the Industrial Revolution forward was the production of food and the Agricultural Revolution brought new products to fields and allowed for this new supplement. Next, people began connecting various specializations, such as traders and inventors or scientists, and with these people working together more products could be manufactured and in turn more people could receive greater standards. Britain became an icon of what could be accomplished when power was put into the hands of the people, at least in a small part, because it drove individuals to succeed, and this created competition that drove new innovation and insight. After seeing all of these advances, many other European states followed Britain and began promoting trade and merchants.

## The Technological Revolution

One characteristic of the Technological Revolution was the accessibility of finer products to a wider range of people from the common to the wealthy, and one of these changes was in the form if pottery, who with the held of division of labor, was able to make itself available to many. Another example of technological innovation was the creation of machines in order to reduce labor load and production costs of materials such as cotton, eventually allowing the British manufacturers to compete globally with the peoples such as the Chinese. Iron was yet another piece of British improvement, as they learned how to create softer iron with coal coke instead of charcoal, allowing them to yield extreme amounts of the metallic resource. One of the most famous inventions, the steam engine came in a few different forms but was critical in the ongoing success of industrial businesses of the time, as it produced labor for cheap. The next place for these innovations to lead was into the market of transportation as new engine designs that created circular motion permitted railroads and train to be developed in order to more efficiently transport both people and goods. Finally the invention of electronic communication arrived in both Europe and the Americas and it pushed communication into the modern era by allowing near instant communication between vast distances.

## The Impact of the Early Industrial Revolution

One of the consequences of the Industrial Revolution was both a pro and a con as the populations of Europe's largest cities began to venture into the millions instead of the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. Rural environments were also an area of concern during the Industrial Revolution as the needs for greater amounts of natural resources exhausted the materials of Britain, which made them advance into the Americas. The working condition in Britain slowly got worse after the Industrial Revolution struck, as workers required less skills in order to operate these cheap dangerous machines. One section of the Industrial Revolution has to do with business cycles which kept the state in a constant cycle of productivity to economic downfall with the swing of the economy.

## Environment and Technology: The Origins of Graphs

Although it can be hard to believe, two dimensional graphs are actually a fairly recent invention and they a critical informational innovation for trading and economics. It was normal for only members of specialized fields such as the sciences to see graphs of this sort but as the common people began to make impacts in their own governments, they began to use these graphs as they concerned themselves with their state's wellbeing. Many people doubted the use of graphs but economists such as Playfair explained that graphs were a great and necessary invention as they were able to communicate quickly and efficiently without focusing on minute information.

## Diversity and Dominance: Adam Smith and the Division of Labor

Adam Smith was a social philosopher and he described the benefits of division of labor in a manufacturing setting. A greater number of people could create huge numbers of products without being educated. Each person in the group only need learn a small portion of the process in order to allow the entire business to create finished products. Small portions of a process were easy to teach as less time with method switching increased overall productivity.
