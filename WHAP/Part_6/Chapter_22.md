# The Early Industrial Revolution, 1760 - 1851

## Causes of the Industrial Revolution

The largest factor that contributed to the Industrial Revolution in Europe was the increase in populations all around Europe, for example, the populations of England and Whales grew by about fifteen million in one hundred an fifty years. The second part of spurring the Industrial Revolution forward was the production of food and the Agricultural Revolution brought new products to fields and allowed for this new supplement. Next, people began connecting various specializations, such as traders and inventors or scientists, and with these people working together more products could be manufactured and in turn more people could receive greater standards. Britain became an icon of what could be accomplished when power was put into the hands of the people, at least in a small part, because it drove individuals to succeed, and this created competition that drove new innovation and insight. After seeing all of these advances, many other European states followed Britain and began promoting trade and merchants.

## The Technological Revolution

One characteristic of the Technological Revolution was the accessibility of finer products to a wider range of people from the common to the wealthy, and one of these changes was in the form if pottery, who with the held of division of labor, was able to make itself available to many. Another example of technological innovation was the creation of machines in order to reduce labor load and production costs of materials such as cotton, eventually allowing the British manufacturers to compete globally with the peoples such as the Chinese. Iron was yet another piece of British improvement, as they learned how to create softer iron with coal coke instead of charcoal, allowing them to yield extreme amounts of the metallic resource. One of the most famous inventions, the steam engine came in a few different forms but was critical in the ongoing success of industrial businesses of the time, as it produced labor for cheap. The next place for these innovations to lead was into the market of transportation as new engine designs that created circular motion permitted railroads and train to be developed in order to more efficiently transport both people and goods. Finally the invention of electronic communication arrived in both Europe and the Americas and it pushed communication into the modern era by allowing near instant communication between vast distances.

## The Impact of the Early Industrial Revolution

One of the consequences of the Industrial Revolution was both a pro and a con as the populations of Europe's largest cities began to venture into the millions instead of the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. Rural environments were also an area of concern during the Industrial Revolution as the needs for greater amounts of natural resources exhausted the materials of Britain, which made them advance into the Americas. The working condition in Britain slowly got worse after the Industrial Revolution struck, as workers required less skills in order to operate these cheap dangerous machines. One section of the Industrial Revolution has to do with business cycles which kept the state in a constant cycle of productivity to economic downfall with the swing of the economy.

## New Economic and Political Ideas

One of the most prominent new ideas was that of a free economy which promoted private businesses taking over trade, manufacturing, and consumption with little government input except to protect their rights. This new system generally improved the welfare of all of the people living in these new areas as competition between businesses promoted cheaper prices and innovation in manufacturing techniques. New reforms that were being put in place in areas such as Britain to control the use of child labor were inspired in part by new ideas about how aspects of industrial society could exist, two of these methods beings utopian socialism and positivism. Finally one of the largest advances in worker society was the creation and collection of groups of workers who shared common tasks in order to coordinate forced reform onto industrial businesses by restricting their own work.

## Industrialization and the Nonindustrial World

Western regions of the world began to dominate the global markets as countries such as Great Britain imported raw materials while exporting great amounts of cheap manufactured goods that other peoples around the world just couldn't compete with. One example of the new power that the Industrial Revolution gave to Britain was in the form of steel boats which could hold many cannons and allowed for Britain to compete with even large countries from around the world. The country of Egypt was almost able to become industrialized under the rule of Muhammad Ali but lost its chance as the war between it and the Ottomans allowed for a flood of cheap British goods. Finally, India tried to implement its own form of industrialization but eventually failed as once again, British powers took control internally and prevented industrial growth.

## Environment and Technology: The Origins of Graphs

Although it can be hard to believe, two dimensional graphs are actually a fairly recent invention and they a critical informational innovation for trading and economics. It was normal for only members of specialized fields such as the sciences to see graphs of this sort but as the common people began to make impacts in their own governments, they began to use these graphs as they concerned themselves with their state's wellbeing. Many people doubted the use of graphs but economists such as Playfair explained that graphs were a great and necessary invention as they were able to communicate quickly and efficiently without focusing on minute information.

## Diversity and Dominance: Adam Smith and the Division of Labor

Adam Smith was a social philosopher and he described the benefits of division of labor in a manufacturing setting. A greater number of people could create huge numbers of products without being educated. Each person in the group only need learn a small portion of the process in order to allow the entire business to create finished products. Small portions of a process were easy to teach as less time with method switching increased overall productivity.

## Conclusion

The Industrial Revolution found its roots in Britain as economic reforms were passed and sources of labor, including artificial labor, were discovered. This new form of labor contributed to Britain being able to manufacture goods like nobody had ever thought possible before that time, and this put them at an unfair competition with the rest of the world that they won. As these industrial practices grew, the gap between the rich and the poor grew, and the people on the top of society lived in fanciful environments while the men and women below lived in dreadful conditions. In total the cheap prices that the Industrial Revolution provided to the British allowed their small area to quickly become a world competing power not to doubted.

# Reflection

words {

Mechanization: One of the most important parts of the Industrial Revolution in Britain had to do with the fact that businesses were finding ways to extend the labor resources past that of ordinary workers. They began to discover how the use of fuels could turn metal machines into efficient labor that vastly reduced prices, and allowed for the British to globally compete.

Production: The British quickly became masters of production. They began to develop methods such as division of labor that further increased the economies efficiency. They were able to produce goods at a rate never before witnessed. This new production gave Britain the power to control other governments such as that of India and Egypt from the inside in order to stop competition.

Imports: Finally, imports were the life blood of Britain. Britain brought in load of raw materials from around the world, and from places such as China, India, and Egypt. Many of these places planned on becoming industrialized themselves but were unable to succeed as Britain influenced governments through trade and war to keep them as lowly suppliers instead of manufacturers.
