#Nature, Humanity, and History to 3500 B.C.E. 


We are introduced to the ideas of very early human life and civilizations. The example given is the Yoruba people of West Africa, who had spawned their own creation myths concerning how they had come to be. In their case, they were ruled by a king known as Oduduwa, who was the son of the Divine Owner of the Sky. Also covered is the idea of how many different culture around the world developed their own creation myths, and how recent scientific research suggests that humans existed many times earlier than that proposed by many creation myths. Finally, we are proposed various questions that make us ponder on important ideas such as why humans advanced past many other species and how it could be connected with our larger brains.

##African Genesis

###Interpreting the Evidence 

In Germany, 1856, fossilized remains of Neanderthals were found, known now to be 40,000 years old, but thought of at the time to be recent deformed individuals. Charles Darwin proposes the Theory of Evolution as a way to explain the remains that are continually found, also proposing that Africa was the original home of early humans, based on the primates currently living there. But, contrary to his hypothesis, many convincing remains were found in Asia, like the Peking Man and Java Man. Even when more ancient evidence was found in Southern Africa, many refused and disputed these ideas since they were convinced that the first home of the humans was Asia. Eventually we are convinced that the original home of the humans was in Africa because it the home of the oldest known remains of early humans. 

*We quickly touch on how age can be measured by finding the rate of molecular change in potassium and dating carbon from natural substances.*

###Human Evolution 

We discuss how their is a family of primates underneath the name hominids, primates are a sub group of mammals. The key traits of hominids that appeared after a length of time include long opposable thumbs, the ability to walk upright, large brains, and a position of the larynx that allowed for greatly improved speech. The Ice Age occurred approximately 10 million years ago and led to many new species developing, in the same way, more climate change 2 to 3 million years ago brought about the homo habilis who had a larger brain, allowing them to eat a greater variety of food. Next, we had the homo erectus, who improved by once again having a larger brain, but also having the ability to walk on two legs in a bipedal manner, increasing their overall survivability. Finally, the section concludes by talking about homo sapiens, which had even larger brains, allowing them to have an amazing ability to speak and communicate amongst each other.

###Migrations from Africa 

Early in the section we talk about how the lower sea levels allowed early humans to migrate away from Africa and while the glaciers were warming up, a wet period was started, allowing for abundant food supplies. After the wet period ended and the human populations increased, we saw the emergence of modern humans, homo sapiens sapiens. This species replaced the homo sapiens and traveled to areas such as Europe, the Americas, Australia, and the Arctic. The oceans eventually rose and isolated the populations from one another. Unlike most species however, the homo sapiens sapiens adapted mostly in terms of mental adaption specific for their environment, in stead of physical adaptions besides small such as skin color. 

##History and Culture in the Ice Age 

Cave paintings are found in Southern France and act as evidence of the amazing intellect that the early humans possessed. Tools and social relationships are both key examples of elements that humans have that make them unique and stand apart from other species. Unlike most species, humans don't live their life according to instincts in their biological DNA, instead they receive information on how to act from the elders of their society. They use culture as their primary knowledge source, something which can be passed down through the generations. 

###Food Gathering and Stone Tools 

Humans made the use of specialized tools popular and the era in which they used stone as an important material in their tools is known now as the Stone Age. After the Ice Age came to an end the early humans started to consume meats in a much larger quantity. Homo habilis, made tools out of chipped volcanic rocks and because of their lower intelligence, it is thought that they scavenged meat left from other predators, having the ability to open bones that were left. Homo erectus had slightly larger brains, giving them the ability to steal the kill of other predators and they also made a multipurpose tool in the form of an ax. The homo sapiens were skillful, they produced a wide variety of tools, including spears, allowing them to kill animals much larger than any one of their species, but over foraging eventually lead to the extinction of many large animals of the era. 

*The Stone Age can be split into two eras: the Paleolithic and the Neolithic (when agriculture emerged).*

*1 to 1.5 million years ago, hot rocks may have been used in cooking (unsure). 12,500 years ago, clay cooking pots are found (probably definitive).*

###Gender Roles and Social Life 

By studying chimpanzees and gorillas, we can infer that early human families consisted of strong bonds between females and their children, with adult males often being recruited for hunting. As we developed, we started having families that usually consisted of a mother, father, and offspring who stayed together, in order to nurture the offspring more effectively. Humans put a lot of thought into the mate they choose and are able to raise children of varying ages, allowing for humans to reproduces quicker than most other mammals. It is believed that females cared for children and gathered food, while adult males would take part in hunting activities. Finally, almost all human bands were migratory in order to coordinate with migrating animals and ripening plants from varying areas.
