# Tropical Africa and Asia, 1200 - 1500

## Tropical Lands and Peoples

The areas of Africa and India are supplied with nutrients thoroughly because of their monsoons that they receive due to being in the tropics. Pastoralists were common in Africa because of its tropical climate which doesn't mean that farming was not also commonplace. Some farmers continually used up new plots of land when old plots became unusable, while others didn't have that option used water control mechanisms. In Africa the most common metals were iron, copper, and gold, at least for economic and cultural purposes, which they tended to sell to outside peoples.

## New Islamic Empires

The Mali empire enforced its new Islamic religion through a show of power, instead of through peaceful diffusion of its peoples. The Mali empire eventually lost power though as set of rulers that was in control were unable to handle their own responsibilities and fulfill the needs of the population. Muslim invaders were able to rapidly spread their faith by destroying and raiding houses of the other faiths and making their presence known wherever they set themselves down. The Turkish rulers were known for using force and terror in order to convince the population to accept their laws and right to rule.

## Indian Ocean Trade

The Indian Ocean Trade acted as an expansive trade route that could connect Africa to other parts of Asia, and it used Dhow as a specialized boat to carry resources and goods. Both the Swahili and Zimbabwe peoples had cities that acted as cultural centers in Africa and nurtured trade and idea that passed through these areas. Aden was a city that acted as an intermediary in trade and it was located near the Red sea, where problems occurred due to the Muslims of Aden being Shi'ites and the one of their neighbors housed Sunnis. Gujarat was a city in India and it was popular because of its prime location on the Malabar coast and that it not only facilitated trading but also produced many of its own goods such as silk and textiles. Malacca was a city in Southeast Asia that was well known for a combination of security and low taxes.

## Social and Cultural Change

Islamic Mosques acted as centers for Muslim religion but were greatly influenced by Hindu temples as the Mosques tended to have to occupy similar of areas within close proximity and cultural diffusion is expected. Muslim scholars of the time period made great advances in Islamic law and studied Greek writings which gave them insight into field such mathematics and medicine, and it was common for Muslim rulers to not force their subjects to convert. One of the common issues found throughout history is the problem of slavery, as it shows up many places, for this case in Africa where African slaves were exported to many parts of the world. In most places women were still given rights that were greatly lower than men and their specific rights varied between different customs.

## Environment + Technology: The Indian Ocean Dhow

The Dhow was a ship construction that originated from the civilizations that used the Indian Ocean. Their main aspect was that they had hulls that were constructed and held together using fibers, instead of using the common nails. This made them lighter and also more resistant to friction damage from hitting other objects while on their journeys. Their second aspect was the triangle sails, something that had already been seen before but not used to this extent. The sails could be turned and the boats varying size all came together to produce something amazingly fast and efficient.

## Diversity and Dominance: Personal Styles of Rule in India and Mali

We learn that the difference between rulers and their subjects was meant to be heightened in India and Mali. Ibn Battuta was a major character who recorded information on government subjects and brought them before the governments that existed. Islam has not satisfied Battuta because he does not believe that it has contributed enough social reform.

## Conclusion

Africa and Asia were home to the large part of the world's population and were also the origin of many important ideas concerning religion study. The Indian Ocean acted as a critical area for the transportation of goods, the communication of people, and the diffusion of cultures that ultimately made the peoples living around it more aware of each other. The isolation of other cultures is what allowed them to become so engrained in those peoples. The cultures of these different groups were strictly maintained and regarded by their individual holders.

# Reflection

words {

Inequality: Inequality was very prominent during these times with gender and race being to big focuses. Gender inequality has almost always been present and in some ways is still present today. Race inequality is interesting because people are able to dehumanize each other for economic benefits.

Diffusion: Peoples in Africa and Asia all tended to blend their cultures from a variety of sources. They didn't always blend nicely, for example, the conflicts between different sects were strong. But, they still contributed concepts such as architecture very nicely.

Trade: Trade is a major part of this chapter, especially concerning the Indian Ocean trade. It allowed for the communication of people who belonged to entirely separate parts of the world. And with advances such as the Dhow sail boat, the ability for civilizations to trade with one another and share information was unprecedented.
