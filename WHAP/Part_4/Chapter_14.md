# The Latin West, 1200 - 1500

## Rural Growth and Crisis

In western Europe the most common form of government that existed was a connection between kings and the serfs who held very little freedoms and paid a majority of their products to their nobles. The Black Death was a plague that scoured over western Europe and removed a large portion of their population, but this actually turned out to be beneficial because they fewer amount of people meant that each person could receive a higher pay. Mines and Mills decreased the price to produce many goods and fights between nobles and their workers broke out as people could not sustain themselves on the current cuts.

## Urban Revival

Many trading cities opened up in western Europe as Christianity and other cultures emerged from other regions and then western peoples learned how to produce their own goods with such quality that they no longer needed to rely on the goods of the outside peoples. Guilds started being founded in the different areas and acted much like the groups we see today that help to protect that standard of living of the people who belong to them, but they also excluded people they didn't agree with. Gothic Cathedrals were big stepping stones for western Europe as it demonstrated what the European people could accomplish as well as showing us the influence that Christianity had on the people of the region.

## Learning, Literature, and the Renaissance

Education became a huge part of the western European culture and it lead to the foundations of many universities that harbored scholars of different subjects, but usually pertaining to theology. Humanists were peoples who studied the different aspects of humanity and sometimes became teachers, further advancing the European education, and the printing press made the transmission of ideas all the more possible through common people. The Renaissance was also very important as it lead to oil paintings and a large number of artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, rising to the surface of the scholarly community.

## Political and Military Transformations

Large governments went through great reform and important factor was that the pope no longer had the same power to challenge higher authorities and monarchies after the papacy went under the control of the French. The Hundred Years War demonstrated the conflict that could occur when different groups were fighting for control of western Europe. New monarchies in western Europe emerged and a large number of new kingdoms divided up, these kingdoms had stricter border lines that helped to keep the people of those kingdoms loyal to the ruling monarchs and only the ones that lived underneath without the fear of people diffusing too quickly with surrounding peoples. Re-conquest was a frequents event and it brought both waves of unity and chaos, but closely resembled the crusades that had come before it.

## Diversity and Dominance: Persecution and Protection of Jews, 1272 - 1349

Persecution of the Jewish people has been seen all around the world and during all different times, but this usually wasn't justified. Luckily, one pope after another began passing new decrees that protected the rights of Jews in the eyes of the Christian people. One common idea that  Christians held was that Jewish people would kidnap their children ad perform horrible acts, but the Pope disagreed and cited information of instances in which the culprits behind issues were Christians who didn't agree with the Jewish views.

## Environment and Technology: The Clock

The clock was an invention that was highly regarded by western Europeans. Although they were not a part of the original creators, they did make clocks an important piece of their life style. Clocks were installed within cathedrals and used to communicate when it was time to pray, and to mark time for other miscellaneous events. At first, clocks were too expensive to be owned by the common person and they were only installed in lavish public areas or for rich households. After clocks became cheap enough, they began to show up in common households around western Europe.

## Conclusion

Technology allowed western European peoples to take advantage of resources such as wind and water to produce and stand on the global market with other manufactured products. The population grew too fast while the amount of food that was being produced didn't improve as quickly and this caused both personal and economic problems throughout western Europe. The rulers of western Europe maintained their powers throughout the centuries and continued to promote their monarchy type rules. Educations was a large part of western Europe as scholars emerged and took the stand and found a place to pursue their studies in newly founded universities.

# Reflection

words = {

Education: Great advances were made in educational institutions and the creation of these institutions allowed for the greater research into specific topics and the evolution of new methods for things such as farming and manufactured products.

Reform: Reform took place in governments as nobles continued to lose power. They started off with great amounts of power and wealth when the population was booming and labor was still considered cheap but after the Black Death, the cost of labor pulled power away from the nobles and eventually lead to slightly more spread out powers.

Religion: Religion took a big hit during the period discussed in this chapter. Many religious figures lost powers as monarchies tended to disagree with the church and they would start conflict with the church officials. Eventually the king of France disagreed with the pope and instituted a French favoring pope but this caused even more issues as the papacy's view on the different countries was biased and people lost trust in the church.
