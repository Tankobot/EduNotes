# Mongol Eurasia and Its Aftermath, 1200 - 1500

## The Rise of Mongols, 1200 - 1260

The Mongols are regarded as nomads, or at least started that way, and followed many ideas of previous peoples, such as arranged marriage and the importance of iron. Genghis Khan started his domination of China in order to secure more tributes and after he died his sons and grandsons took control of his empire and split it into four areas. The Mongols tended to use primitive war technologies except when it came to bows, and when they attempted to conquer a city, if the people of the city surrendered quickly, they were given hospitality, but if they resisted, they were starved and slaughtered. The Mongols encouraged trade and on the most part this was good but it inspired the great pandemic in which diseases such as the bubonic plague spread all over Asia and Europe.

## The Mongols and Islam 1260 - 1500

The Il-khan state established the Golden Horde and some of the rulers converted to Islam and became Muslims as a way to help cross the boundary that existed between the Muslims and the Mongols. They attempted to institute new ideas in the government, but these concepts eventually lead to a decline in the government that was only saved by Timur who was not related to the Khan but helped the Mongol empire for a short period. Historians were encouraged and they started to create the first world history collections of knowledge by talking to different peoples. The Mongols actually made great contributions in cosmology and mathematics as their leaders expressed interest in those subjects and the advancements that were made found their way into European areas.

## Regional Responses in Western Eurasia

In Russia Mongol ideals were consistently opposed and the Mongols starved the economies and raided villages, which only worsened the position. New information has lead to the idea that the Mongols actually didn't have as large of an effect as we had thought, but instead the princes who ruled practiced corruption and much of the issues inside of Russia were self generated. The Mongols were actively dealing with crusades until the Teutonic Knights drowned in a lake and the Northern crusades halted and Mongol technological advancement continued. A large amount of independent states emerged by cooperating with the Mongols and the Ottoman Empire grew in power with only a few setbacks from Russian rulers.

## Mongol Domination in China, 1271 - 1368

The Mongols destroyed what existed in China and instead they replaced the area with Confucian teachings and unified the peoples, although this time they put Mongols at the top of the social hierarchy. Many great ideas such as shared corporations emerged but issues also arose as the Mongols in China made the same mistake as the Golden Horde and they drove out farmers until the empire could not sustain itself. Technology became a new source of interest for the Mongols as people were suffering from plagues and health complications, the Mongols also supported the construction of astronomical buildings. The Mongols' Yuan empire fell but lead to the nomadic Mongols once again appearing, leaving area for the Ming.

## The Early Ming Empire, 1368 - 1500

Ming China emerged from a monk and ruler who was popular for his anti-Mongol ways, but he later passed on the power and the Ming accidentally inherited a majority of the Mongol ideas on how to run the government. Emphasis on trade and reconnecting with other civilizations took precedence until problems arose in the empire and the government focus had to move towards military expeditions. The Ming empire experienced a reverse in the appearance of technologies with mining being limited and the Ming disconnected themselves even more so from other peoples and ultimately set themselves behind. The most known achievement of the Ming was their development of porcelain and writing.

## Centralization and Militarism in East Asia, 1200 - 1500

Korean rulers resisted the Mongols for a long amount of time but eventually surrendered and allowed their government to be occupied by Mongol descendants, until the Yi retook Korea and continued the use of Mongol ideas. The Mongols, after securing Korea, went on to attempt to take control of Japan but they failed on multiple tries due to weather complications and the preparation that Japanese leaders took once the Mongol threat unified Japan. After the Mongol threat disappeared, the Japanese government lost control and after many civil wars, the area settled into formations of small regions. Vietnam was also unified when the Mongols occupied the nearby territory but after both the Mongols and the Ming, Vietnam grew into the modern Annam state.

## Diversity and Dominance: Mongol Politics, Mongol Women

Because the Mongols were generally a nomadic society, the women of the society had more freedoms. The society was less patriarchal than what was commonly seen in bigger civilizations. The women of a family won through seniority and had control over younger males. They could not advance to the status of khan but instead organized the best environment in which to lead their sons or relatives who could become the khan.

## Environment + Technology

Gunpowder was first produced in China by a monk who had great interest in alchemy. Charcoal and saltpeter were combined to create a highly flammable substance. Flamethrowers were developed that could use this substance to ignite enemy ships and people. Explosives containing refined saltpeter were used to open enemy fortifications. Scatter-shot cannons were produced by the Song dynasty. Regular canons were later produced that fired full sized single canon balls and could destroy large amounts of defenses.

## Conclusion

The Mongols through their force and rapid expansion contributed a large amount to the unification of many different areas. The Mongols also inspired renewed trade among these lands and helped to promote growth of wealth and the spread of technological ideas. An issue that was caused by this new trade was disease, which could now travel long distances and cause massive death tolls around the eastern world. After the Mongol invasions slowed down though, the areas that had been conquered were breaking away from Mongol control and emerging with the newfound unity of the Mongols while still being of their original ethnic background.

# Reflection

words {

unification: The Mongols acted as a brutal force in their area no doubt. But that doesn't mean that they didn't also have a positive effect on their conquered areas. Specifically, the Mongols gave peoples who were fighting internally a reason to unite and become stronger.

communication: The Mongols inspired a new era of communication among different civilizations. The trade routes that they built were not only helpful for them when they collected taxes on good but they also benefited others. Different people were able to transmit new ideas and concepts around the world like never before. The new use of trade routes allowed for the rapid development of new technologies in different places.

post: This chapter has a lot to do with what happened after the Mongols. What they left as a seed for the new set of peoples. For example, Russia wouldn't have been able to accomplish its political goals if it wasn't for their resistance against the Mongols. They like many other peoples were left with an everlasting scar due to the power that the Mongols expressed during their expansion over the Eastern world.
