# The Maritime Revolution, to 1550

## Global Maritime Expansion Before 1450

Ships even at during these periods were considered both the fastest and the cheapest way to haul large amounts of goods across large stretches of the world connected by water. The Pacific Ocean wasn't used for a lot of high volume trade during this time period, but it contributed towards the colonization of many islands by Polynesian people. The Indian Ocean could carry huge volumes of resources across the eastern world and could generate large wealth for the traders who used it outside of countries. The Indian Ocean also acted as a way for different countries to interact with one another, for example, Zheng He impressed many people with the power of China by travelling along the Indian Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean was home to Vikings who attacked coastal areas but also colonized a few Northern Islands.

## European Expansion, 1400 - 1550

The Iberian kingdoms present in Europe sent out expeditions in order to discover new areas, in this case the Americas were found and settled. The reason why the Iberian kingdoms wished to expand was for the economical benefits, as they could pull in new resources from lands that they could control and have exclusive access to, separate from other countries. The Portuguese were inspired to expand due to their tensions with Islamic powers, because if they gained more areas they might have a chance of gaining the upper hand on Islamic kingdoms of Africa. Everyone knows about Christopher Columbus and his discovery of America, but this was mostly due to luck.

## Encounters with Europe, 1450 - 1550

Western Africa had many unique interactions with Europe and was heavily influenced by the European traders who retrieved resources from various parts of Africa. Eastern Africa on the other hand was heavily influenced by both European and Muslim powers, while also providing their own resources from areas such as Ethiopia. Although the Indian Ocean was a very important trading region, it did not lead very well to Europe and was disconnected from that side of the world, even though Europeans sometimes ventured across the world to see this far. The Americas were visited by the Spaniards but quickly the Spaniards took control and power away from the native population and started to run things themselves.

## Environment and Technology: Vasco da Gama's Fleet

Da Gama's fleet of ships, although small compared to the fleets of the superpowers of the time, was actually large for the region that it was from, Portugal. The ships were able to impress many different people of the power that the Chinese held. The ships were also heavily stocked with a variety of resources that were in excess to what was needed, but was carried anyways to help ensure nothing could go wrong. The expedition was supplied with so many resources because it was expected that it would open new trade routes for Portugal.

## Diversity and Dominance: Kongo's Christian King

The Kongo government of the time period accepted a large amount of people from sea in order to increase their social, political, and economical possibilities. Some of the kings also adopted Christianity as a result of having large interactions with European peoples. The Europeans were very interested with the products or raw resources that could be exported from the African lands and regions. Christianity was given an injection of African culture when it was adopted.

## Conclusion

An era during this chapter was marked special apart from the rest because of the major contributions it put towards the exploration of regions outside of Europe and Asia. Most of the expansion and travelling was caused by the search for better or more efficient trading routes to take profit from. The conquests of the Americas can be compared to the conquests that the Mongols enacted onto European and Asian regions. Eventually the Atlantic Ocean would be converted into a trading path the could compete with the Indian Ocean trading area.

# Reflection

words {

Maritime: Maritime areas are what allowed for the immense volume of trade that we see passing through all of these popular sea fairing zones. They allow for the exchange of resources freely among different countries.

Expansion: A variety of different civilizations expanded during this time period and it allowed for the opening of new routes to different places. It also increased competition between different countries and inspired greater commerce.

Conquer: A large part of what occurred during this age of expansion was the removal of peoples who got in the way of larger powers. Instead of respecting the rights of the people currently living in an area, most countries that had the wealth decided to take the easier route and smother out the current governments that existed in newly discovered lands.
