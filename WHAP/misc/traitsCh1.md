#Civilization Traits: Chapter 1 

##Egypt 

Leadership: The Pharoah took control and was able to command thousands of people while still maintaining a fair amount of support from even the lower-class. This is a characteristic that defines the abilities of the Egyptians and their government. 

Loyalty: The citizens of Egypt demonstrated a massive amount of loyalty towards most of their rulers. This was in part because a large maajority of the population believed that the Pharaoh was divine and his actions affected the public's view of his worthiness to control. 

##Early Mesopotamian City-States 

Individuality: Each of the city-states in the area were varied and you can see the differences between the societies, such as Babylon and the Sumerians. Different city-states demonstrated some of their differences through the use of patron gods to distinguish themselves. 

Acceptance: Even though there was a strong sense of individuality, Mesopotamian societies also accepted populations into each other. A good example of this absorbtion comes from the Sumerians, who were eventually merged with the Babylonian population. 

##Indus Valley Civilizations 

Punctuality: I consider the Indus Valley civilizations to demonstrate some sense of punctuality, as the textbook lets us know that they built cities and roads in a structured rectangular fashion common today. 

Individuality: As a whole civlization the Indus Valley maintained a fair individual nature because of the little communication they had with neighboring civilizations. They were sort of isolated from others due to their locaton. 

##Shang 

Honor: They honored their family and leaders with great regard due to their ideas of filial piety, along with other religious beliefs that dictated how members of a family should act and how people should react. 

Pride: They thought they were all powerful and no one could overcome their power. Although this was eventualy disprovin by their decline, it demonstrated how convinced they were of their high self-worth, and of the accomplishments they could reach. 

##Zhou 

Leadership: The Zhou leaders were chosen by the Mandate of Heaven making them the chosen leaders. Their popularity was enforced by the idea that if they made poor decisions, it was the job of the public to rebel and either take over, or not. If overthrew the current ruler, then that ruler had lost the Mandate of Heaven, otherwise if the ruler won, he still controlled the Mandate of Heaven. 

Commitment: Because of confucianism, everyone was committed to their families and strong relationships between family members helped to support the communities as a whole. 

##Olmec 

Punctuality: They created the calendar which made all of their dates exact. This allowed them to schedule events with accurate precision, giving them an advantage on people who relied solely on the weather. 

Optimism: They uses of sacrifices demonstrated how they had optimism in the practices they practiced. Although these decision might not be accepted in today's standards, you can definitely see how optimism in the societies beliefs can help to make people feel more reassured. 

##Chavin 

Commitment: The Chavin were commited to their beliefs and this was probably for the better, as it allowed for Rulers to maintain better power control. The commitment to their beliefs help keep control with the few so as to orderly organize the labor force of the society. 

Loyalty: Like the Egyptians the Chavin were loyal to the elite because of their divine nature. This is a reoccuring theme in many different civilizations as it makes sense for rulers who want to have better support. The Chavin took advantage of this method and were able to create large structures such as public works due to their support.
