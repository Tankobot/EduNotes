This repository is dedicated to storing notes about various subjects and books. 

##Contribution

You can contribute in many ways, one of those ways is giving us your ideas on our forum located [here](http://edunotes.boards.net/). 

The other method of contribution is much simpler, post an issue on this GitHub repository letting us know about things such as spelling mistakes, formatting problem, etc. in our existing projects.
